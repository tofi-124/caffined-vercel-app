0:00  tonight. But, uh, the topic today, you know, is kind of picking up where we've left off in this six-part series. Uh, so
0:08  we've done parts one through three in part one. Um, coffee is a plant. We kind
0:13  of focus on the biology of cafe arabica. Um, its habitat, how it expanded
0:19  throughout the world. In part two, um, we look at coffee farming. uh we look at
0:24  the life cycle of the plant and then yearly tasks producers are commonly
0:29  having to do to maintain um a farm um and be productive. In part three we look
0:35  at coffee processing um so all the post-h harvest steps processing drying
0:40  milling and today in part four we're kind of picking up where that's that leads off um and we are looking at
0:47  coffee as as a greater industry right coffee in terms of its commerce. So, we
0:53  are picking up after the coffee has been milled and we are looking at the actual exchange of coffee, right? Exporting and
0:58  importing, green buying, um those kinds of things. There's a lot of directions you could go with this topic, right?
1:05  It's um pretty involved. There's tons of practices depending on where you are in the world in terms of how coffee is
1:11  bought and sold. Um, and so we're obviously not going to be able to get
1:16  hyper specific about coffee buying, but really what we want to look at is the
1:21  sea market versus specialty coffee, how coffee is actually bought and sold
1:27  within specialty coffee. Um, and then a little discussion about what
1:32  transparency means and what that looks like for our industry, right? So, um,
1:37  what is an industry? That's a question. An industry is a distinct group of
1:42  productive enterprises, right? It's a group of businesses that produce a similar good or service, right? Pretty
1:47  straightforward. Um, in coffee, you know, there are not only are there like
1:54  many brands that are producing coffee, but there's multiple businesses that kind of help that reach its end product,
2:01  right? And we call that the supply chain. So the supply chain is kind of that um that sequence of businesses,
2:09  right? And everybody within the supply chain needs to be profitable, right? In
2:14  order to keep going. And this is something we talk about a lot in coffee, right? Um the idea that everybody um has
2:21  costs, everybody has challenges. Um everybody is located in vastly different areas of the world. So making sure value
2:29  is distributed across the supply chain is something that's really important in specialty coffee. Um so as we're going
2:35  you know through these classes that's something we're kind of trying to track here is like what are all the tasks what
2:41  are the costs involved just with this very specific point in the coffee supply chain. Right? So, we've discussed
2:47  farming, um processing and milling, right? Lots of equipment, water, space, time, um and
2:55  then your actual mill. Lots of equipment. It's essentially a factory, right? Um
3:02  today we'll be looking more at exporting, right? So the logistics of moving coffee from the mill to the port
3:09  then shipping that coffee to import right to the next port city and then um
3:15  getting that coffee to its final warehouse destination um and coffee gets right and then the
3:23  coffee is roast packaged brewed and served. Um, so we're exporting and
3:29  importing. That's kind of what we're what we're focusing on today. That exchange between exporter and importer,
3:35  whoever those parties might be, right? We're going to try and outline those entities in today class. Who is selling
3:41  coffee? Who is buying coffee? And how does that exchange actually work? Um, at
3:46  every exchange, right? At every exchange between parties, um, prices are set, um,
3:52  by the seller um, or they're negotiated, right? depending on the circumstance.
3:58  Um, and every business must act in its own self-interest first um, to be
4:04  profitable. Um, but we are also as an industry trying to be vigilant and aware
4:09  of the impact um, we are having on one another and the planet. And that's kind of where we'll talk about um,
4:14  traceability a little bit because coffee is grappling with big questions, right? 2024 was a volatile year. 2025 has
4:22  already been far more volatile than 24. Coffee has recently hit um the highest
4:27  price it's ever hit on the C market, which is like great in some ways, right? It's great for many producers, but the
4:34  fact that the market is that volatile means you cannot rely on that price always staying there. And so, um you
4:42  know, this year might be really good, but who knows what's going to happen next year, right? So in our industry,
4:49  sustainability has become just as important as like almost any other factor about coffee, right? When
4:56  specialy coffee first came about, we're so focused on the cup. Um but sustainability, you know, has become
5:03  uh really important especially as because coffee is becoming more and more threatened, right? Um, we know coffee
5:11  propagated around the world because of colonialism and in many countries in many instances slavery is what
5:17  established coffee as a a cash crop, right? Um, most coffee is grown in areas that would be considered underserved.
5:24  The majority of smallh holders incomes um sit below the world poverty line. So,
5:29  rightfully we ask the questions of like how is coffee prices set? Who sets the price? um how many um parties, how many
5:38  middlemen are involved between the farmer and roster, right? How can we guarantee fair compensation is being
5:45  insured back to the roster? And then how is quality actually measured and fairly
5:51  rewarded, right? Um these are complex questions. We can't answer them all tonight, but when we're talking about
5:57  coffee as a greater industry um as a system um that's been being developed
6:02  for many years, these are important questions to ask. If we were going to answer these questions really simply, um
6:08  our kind of uh capitalist answer would be it's the market control these things,
6:14  right? The market sets the price. The market um allows the price to fluctuate.
6:19  Um how is fair compensation insured? The market, right? um whether that's you
6:24  know the market within the industry the people who are sourcing copy or the consumers themselves right so
6:33  we're going to kind of dive into that market and look at what markets actually are but um a market in its simplest term
6:40  is the means by which you know an exchange of goods and services takes place right it's everybody just involved
6:47  with buying a product um so
6:52  kind of going through that fast this intro. I want to get into the the meat of the class. I'm still editing this down a little bit. But the big point I
7:00  like to make when we're talking about these things is we need to remember that industries, supply chains, markets,
7:07  coffee, coffee is all about people, right? People are what substantiate
7:12  these concepts. Um these are not um abstract. These are not, you know,
7:18  tight-knit groups. um it's all comprised of people who are working in coffee at
7:24  that given moment, right? Um and so it's important for us when we're looking at
7:29  these systems, systems that date back a long way, it's important to question those systems to um evolve those systems
7:37  to try and reinvent them when there are problems, right? Topics of price, transparency, impact, sustainability,
7:43  traceability, all these words. Um, they're complex, they're often discussed, they're rooted in ethics
7:50  because, you know, we're talking about people's livelihoods. So, coffee is
7:56  people. That's the important thing to remember as we go through today's class.
8:02  Every single person, every business has to be profitable. Everybody has to make decisions that help themselves first. Um
8:09  but coffee as we know is built on relationships throughout the supply
8:14  chain right um you know one of our values as a company at cafe and boards
8:21  is to increase the quality of life for everybody involved right our business decisions we also want to include that
8:28  it must include that increasing the quality of life right we all want to leave the world better than when we
8:34  found it we all want to lift one another up and so there's no perfect answer. If
8:40  somebody had the answer um to fix the industry, that's how we would do things, right? Um but we don't know exactly the
8:48  best way to operate this. And so today um we're going to kind of dive into the
8:53  C market, what specialty coffee is in reaction to the C market, how coffee is
8:58  actually bought and sold, and what transparency is. So big intro. The whole
9:05  point so far we need to remember that it's always about it's always about people, right? Um uh Rajes has a
9:12  question. Excuse me if I'm not pronouncing your name right. Does an investment bank like JPMC influence the
9:18  price inc market? That's a great question. I am not absolutely positive
9:24  on the answer at the moment, but I would imagine if an investment bank is buying
9:31  Ca contracts, right, they are participating in the C market, if they
9:36  are buying up massive amounts of contracts or moving masses of amounts of coffee, it will impact the price. I'm
9:43  not I'm not even sure who, you know, JPMC is, but um uh what would that be
9:50  like? JP Morgan Chase. Morgan Chase. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, I would imagine they do they do
9:56  persuade it. You know, not as heavily as some other factors, but if um you know,
10:02  they're buying a lot of fluctuation, but then that's mainly to the weather and you know, the
10:09  weather events, isn't it? And the supply being lesser compared to
10:16  the previous years. Mhm. and the demand being more.
10:21  Yeah, I would imagine imagine that would absolutely affect it. Sorry, I couldn't hear you too well there if you asked a
10:27  follow-up question. Feel free to repeat. Now I was just trying to compare uh to
10:33  the prices you know being it's it's been the highest in the decade and uh it's it
10:40  was mainly attributed to the weather events I believe and not um you know not a bullish market like
10:48  where the investment banks are you know put putting in funds into the market and then fluctuating the price that's not
10:55  the case isn't it? Yeah, not exactly. I mean, coffee is, you know, it's so weird
11:02  right now because the market has also been um inverted for like years. So,
11:09  it's just kind of like hit this this break point where where prices bubbled and also, you know, Brazil's outlook
11:16  played a factor into it. um and uh
11:22  like everything kind of hit that that tipping point um at the at the exact same time. So
11:29  yeah. Yeah. And I'm you know I'm personally not a trader. I'm not super
11:35  super active in keeping up with like every little thing that's happening with the um the C market. But it is pretty
11:44  wild that that you know the coffee hit as high of a point as it did this year. Um so let's and kind of like get into
11:52  some of the basics of the C market. Um thank you. Yeah, no problem. And please ask
11:58  questions throughout. I'll do my best to answer some uh some things and uh keep
12:04  it going here. So C market, what is the C market? I think when I first started
12:09  in coffee, um, I didn't really understand exactly what the C market was. Um, and I don't know, I maybe
12:17  thought about it as, you know, like just a place or
12:24  just kind of like a platform in which you could buy coffee, right? Which it kind of is. Um, but really it's a place
12:30  for for buying contracts for coffee, futures contracts, right? So the C market, it's a global standardized
12:37  marketplace. And there are other coffee markets. There's the Rabusta market, right? Um run out of Europe. The C
12:44  market is run out of New York. It originated um in 1968
12:50  um kind of in response to the international coffee agreements of 1962.
12:56  In 1962, you know, import quotas um and supply
13:02  quotas um were set. So like basically producing countries were told how much
13:07  they could produce, importing countries were told how much they could import and they tried to balance supply and demand
13:13  through quotas. Um and that didn't totally work right. Um it kind of dissolved those agreements. Can it be um
13:21  held together in 1968? And so um many producers outside of Brazil wanted a way
13:27  to help differentiate their coffee. Brazil produces most of the world's coffee, right? Um and so um the sea
13:35  market was was established to kind of help balance this supply and demand. Right? When Brazil harvest coffee,
13:42  there's lots of available coffee on the market. Price tends to go down. Other producers were feeling the effect of
13:49  those prices dropping. Um so uh the seed market was created so that producers when they're harvesting at other times
13:55  they have, you know, a better chance of not being, you know, out competed by Brazil. And so that's why we see that
14:02  the C market is so volatile, right? It goes up and down and up and down mostly
14:08  because of Brazil and then a lot of other factors then playing into that, right? When Brazil has big harvests
14:16  um versus Brazil having not so great harvest, right? You're going to see the
14:22  market fluctuate a lot more. Ultimately, when it comes to commodity markets,
14:27  people selling a product want to sell when prices are high and buyers want to
14:33  buy when prices are low. Right? So, a market like this where you're buying
14:38  contracts for coffee to be delivered in the future allows both of these parties
14:44  to protect themselves. Right? Suppliers are people who are selling coffee. if
14:50  they feel like the market's at a high point and it's gonna go down, it allows them to sell contracts of their coffee
14:56  at that moment, right? And protect themselves against a low future market and vice versa. So supply and demand
15:04  um is is ultimately what determines the market price, right? And we can go
15:10  through this more and more, but the market price well back up here. Um
15:17  typically when you see an increase in supply you have less demand for that product right if you see um a low supply
15:27  of product you'll have a lot higher demand for that product and that is
15:32  going to impact the price right so supply goes up demand tends to go down right you have
15:40  higher supply demand goes down the price will go down I think the next slide actually shows this better here we
15:46  So, here's our supply line. The supply line
15:52  increases, right? It moves to the right. Here's our new supply line. There's less
15:57  demand for the product and the price decreases, right? So, this is like
16:04  obviously really basic. Many of us probably know this, but um the market's
16:10  actors, right? buyers and sellers and then spectators, people who are also
16:16  buying contracts without the intention of ever receiving coffee. They are basically reacting to the current market
16:22  situation and guessing where it's going to go. As we can see in coffee, coffee is really volatile. Um so it's hard to
16:30  do that perfectly, right? But um buyers and sellers are guessing where the market's about to go. they're taking
16:37  inventory of what they have at that moment in time and then making a
16:42  decision on buying or selling contracts at that certain time. So again, every
16:48  year Brazil harvests, supply skyrockets, demand tends to go down, price tends to go down. We know that happens every
16:55  year. Um, but if Brazil has a bad year, I make
17:00  things even a little bit crazier, right? So what are we actually trading? We're not necessarily trading coffee at that
17:07  exact moment, right? You're not going to the commodity market and buying coffee
17:12  and then that coffee immediately ships. You're buying a contract for coffee. A futures contract, which is what a lot of
17:18  commodity markets are based on, um are basically
17:23  contracts that are selling a quantity of something at a certain quality and then that product is delivered at a time,
17:31  place, and price in the future. So, in coffee, the quality we're talking
17:37  about is commercial wash coffee, and there's 20 different countries that um qualify for this. The quantity is always
17:44  in increments of one container or 37,500 pounds.
17:50  The coffee will be delivered in one of these kind of semesters, March, May, July, September, December to one of
17:57  eight warehouses. Um and the price is based on the current spot price. That
18:04  price will change in the future when the coffee is actually delivered. So
18:10  that is what people are trading for, right? They're trading for contracts. Um sellers saying, "Hey, I will deliver
18:18  coffee in six months um for this price today, right? And if the supplier likes
18:25  that price, they'll go ahead and secure that contract. So on and so forth. I'm
18:30  not doing great at explaining this, I feel like, but um and then there spectators, right? People who are buying and selling contracts without ever
18:37  receiving coffee. They're just betting on which way the market's going to go, right? Trying to turn profits off of
18:43  those bets. And so all of this leads to the discovery of price. It's supposed to
18:48  keep price stable, right? Or keep it within a band. Um, but as we can see,
18:53  there are plenty of other impacts that that affect coffee, right? And make that price go
19:00  shoot skyh high like it did this year or drop very very low like it did, you know, I think back to like what was that
19:06  like 2019 when coffee was underneath a dollar per pound. So, what impacts the
19:12  seed price outside of supply and demand? Brazil again, Vietnam um and Colombia
19:17  also produce a lot of coffee. Vietnam is behind Brazil at 17% of production. Brazil's at around 40%. And then
19:24  Colombia is at 7%. Um so high productivity in Brazil drives prices
19:29  down. Um and then productivity in those countries will also affect um the
19:35  market. Uh weather, right? Especially in Brazil, weather patterns, guessing
19:40  what's going to happen with weather can move the market price. Geopolitics. Um
19:46  so instability can cause a country to export or import more or less coffee obviously. Um and then transport costs
19:54  right other costs of living. Um years of epic hardship are going to affect the
20:00  market. Um when things are really expensive like we saw during uh during COVID shipping was so expensive uh that
20:08  coffee dropped pretty heavily in price right or stayed low from where it was in 2019. So, lots of other impacts in
20:16  price, right? The lowest we've seen 41 cents. Highest we've seen just this past
20:21  year 440, right? The question is obviously does the C price affect the
20:28  specialty price? And yes, like obviously something being sold at 41 cents versus
20:36  440 is going to affect even the premium product. So,
20:42  um, one thing to note about the C price, this is going back to the early 70s,
20:49  is that you can see over time if you adjusted for inflation, I've never seen a chart adjusted for inflation. Um, I
20:55  think that'd be cool to create, but we've been paying pretty much less and less and less for coffee over the years,
21:02  right? Specialty coffee kind of being a reaction to the sea market. Um, I think
21:10  a big part of specialty is obviously paying more for coffee, right? But we've been paying less and less and less and
21:17  um, many of us have heard probably that, you know, 41 cents a pound obviously
21:22  even at this time. But like I said in 2019 when coffee was underneath a dollar per pound, that's not enough for a
21:30  producer to actually make money on the amount of coffee they're producing, right? Um, and so what is specialty
21:37  coffee? Depends who you ask. How do you define it? Um, but specialty coffee is
21:42  is kind of a reaction to to this market, right? A market that calls all coffee
21:50  the same. It is just trading for contracts um without any more traceability than that, right? So, I
21:58  don't feel like I did a great job of explaining the C market there, but if we have any questions, please ask any questions. Maybe that'll help me um do a
22:06  little bit better. But it's a place for trading contracts for coffee, right? And that coffee will eventually be delivered
22:11  um when that contract expires. Um but
22:16  uh that is that is essentially the seed market, right?
22:22  Okay, there's no questions. We can keep going here.
22:28  So let's see what is specialty coffee then
22:38  it's almost easier to say what specialty coffee isn't right or contrasting it to the C market um it is not a standardized
22:46  marketplace right nobody controls specialty coffee there's no governing
22:52  body there is no market where all transaction information is being uploaded like the C market um is not a
23:00  contract-based marketplace, right? And it doesn't call all coffee the same. Um
23:06  you know, we've seen definitions for specialty coffee come and go. The most
23:12  recent kind of definitions, you know, we've been talking about are recognizing
23:17  its qualities, right? Its distinctness both in the cup or outside of the cup.
23:23  Um uh it's about recognizing who actually produced it, right? It's about
23:29  recognizing how it was processed and how unique that cup is compared to every
23:35  other cup, right? Every cup of coffee is unique in and of itself. Um so
23:41  recognizing that specialtist that specialness and then focusing on the human skill and the human artisanship um
23:48  of every step is all kind of wrapped up in what we think of as specialty coffee,
23:54  right? Um but ultimately specialty coffee is people saying this thing is good and
24:00  paying more money for it essentially. Um the challenge has always been you know
24:06  defining quality. Let me go back to this real quick. The story of specialty coffee is largely
24:13  an an industry's kind of journey in defining what quality means because
24:18  coffee doesn't have quality inside of it. Right? Coffee has sugars and acids
24:23  and salts and bitter components inside of it. It doesn't have a thing called quality in it. Right? So, it's really
24:30  our perception of these flavors imbued into the coffee by everything that it's
24:36  gone before um to give it its kind of standout quality, right? Compared to everything else. Um but there's an
24:43  agreed upon almost a cultural sense of what quality means, right? Um so quality
24:50  is the standard of something measured against other things. The easiest thing to measure specialty coffee against is
24:55  against Caarket coffee, right? If you taste normal commodity coffee, it is very different than what you would drink
25:02  going into a specialty cafe, right? The other thing is distinctive attributes or
25:08  characteristics, right? The characteristics of each cup being recognized. The challenge is that
25:15  quality is subjective. People like different things, right? Um flavor is
25:20  built on our physiology, on our biology, and our memory and our experiences.
25:26  Those are all extremely personal, right? It all adds to the subjectivity of quality. Um, and measuring something
25:34  that is subjective is really challenging, right? It requires very
25:40  particular kinds of tests um to be able to measure something. But at the same
25:47  time, subjectivity isn't bad. We are all
25:52  um allowed to have our opinions within specialy coffee, right? As a roaster or as an importer. If we don't have an
25:58  opinion, we're probably not very good at our job at the same time. Um we all have
26:03  different tastes. We serve customers of different tastes and we seek out coffees with those tastes, right? Um quality is
26:10  subjective, but we know what we like and that's really important, too. So, um, we know specialty coffee often comes down
26:17  to sweet, balanced, clean, um, coffees
26:22  and that the more distinctive those coffees get, right? Um, in a way that we
26:29  like, they get more rewarded monetarily, right? Um, so calibrating ourselves to
26:36  what is good and then what is super distinct and above and beyond good. Um,
26:42  again, it's been a journey for specialty coffee. Um, specialty coffee has changed
26:47  a lot since even I've been in it, right? So, um, before the 1900s, coffee is
26:54  based purely on physical appearance, right? We're not even tasting the product. Um, in the early 1900s, that's
27:00  when we get a few people from a few importers that start tasting coffee and describing it. Um, and it goes a long
27:09  time up to 1974 where the first time specialy coffee as
27:14  a term comes about. Um, and if you've heard of Erna Nudson, then you probably know kind of her story, but she worked
27:21  for an importer. Leftover bags from lots of coffee. She would cup test those,
27:26  right? She would taste them and she would sell these individual or really
27:31  small amounts of coffee to small roasters, right? based on their flavors. So this is kind of the first instance of
27:39  like an importer finding lots and describing those lots to small roasters,
27:44  right? So kind of the rise of the smaller roster um that we see come about in the 80s, 90s and 2000s, right? Kind
27:52  of preceded all of that. The SEAA is established. Ted Lingal creates the coffee cupers handbook which we'll come
27:59  back to. the Europe chapter of specialy coffee associations established and then in 2004
28:05  we see the cupping form right adopted as the main way that we are tasting and
28:11  grading coffee um pushed by you know the education for it pushed by CQI
28:18  um backed up by the SDA Europe and America merge into the big the larger SCA body that we know today
28:25  right but from 2004 on until really until this year we were cupping coffee
28:32  off of this cupping form that Ted Lingal created. Throughout this time, we're
28:38  getting lots of different definitions of specialty coffee. It's the highest quality green coffee beans roasted to
28:44  their greatest by true crafts people, right? The best coffee roasted the best way by the best people and brewed
28:51  perfectly, right? That's specialty coffee. Um and that was back you know in
28:57  the 90s that definition was given. Over time we saw the definition get a lot more specific right a lot more uh
29:05  numbers right trying to quantify specialty um no you know zero category
29:12  one defects no more than five category 2 defects and on our cupping form it
29:19  scores 80 plus points. So again, quantifying quality is pretty
29:26  much impossible. Um, but specialty coffee for many years has kind of been boiled down to its score, right? This 80
29:34  to 100 point score. So
29:39  again, it at the end of the day for a lot of discussion coffee, it does come down to that final cup. Um, we were scoring
29:46  fragrance, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, um, balance, uniformity in cups.
29:52  sweetness and our overall impression. Right? So on this form we are describing
29:58  coffee. We are writing down what we are experiencing but then we are assigning a
30:03  value to that experience. Right? Day in and day out when we are tasting coffee
30:09  um we're subject to the entire context that we're tasting within. Right? You
30:15  can taste coffee one day and score it lower than the next day. But there was no better way really to come up with
30:21  like describing and scoring coffee that stood out to us, right? So it was an
30:28  imperfect way of scoring coffee, but it gave us a language and years over years
30:33  over years from 2004 on um the QGrading system and this score sheet established
30:40  a language of talking about coffee flavor and scoring it internationally.
30:46  Right. Q-Graders um were the people who went through the
30:53  the training system um who really established the language and the scoring
30:59  metrics um they had to take six day training program pass 22-part exam um to
31:06  become a Q-grader and that was kind of like the gold standard but at the same time you know
31:13  there's you know hundreds of thousands of roasters out there who are buying coffee, you know, the people who are
31:20  really buying coffee, roasting it and selling it to their customers, um, who
31:25  are also involved with this, right? Um, who also bought coffee even though they weren't QG graders. So,
31:33  this just changed this year. So, it's become interesting to talk about, you know, that phase of specialty
31:40  coffee. Um, this EQI that used to certify QG graders, it's
31:46  now been been handed to the SCA. I'm going to skip some of these.
31:53  Um, and but that 80 to 100 points that's pretty much kind of stayed, right? Like
32:00  a coffee that scores 80 plus is specialty and that tells us how differentiated that coffee is over sub80
32:08  coffees, right? over C market coffees. So the biggest thing with cupping um and
32:15  with scoring coffees is that the brewing of the coffee needs to be absolutely consistent. The coffees should be tasted
32:23  blind. Um we shouldn't know what the coffees are. Um and then we are tasting,
32:29  describing and scoring those individual aspects of the coffee to get that final
32:35  score. Right? And all of that is supposed to then contribute to price.
32:40  The challenge with that is if the people producing coffee don't
32:46  know our language or if the people producing coffee don't know what we value and that's not a very transparent
32:54  system, right? And that's what made coffee challenging for a long time. It
33:00  was the people buying coffee saying what the product was worth, not the people
33:05  producing the coffee, right? And that's different than most industries. Um that is not how it's supposed to be, right?
33:12  Where um the buyer sets the price. That doesn't happen. The seller is supposed to set the price. And so another aspect
33:19  of specialty coffee has been, you know, basically
33:25  leveling the playing field, right? not only recognizing
33:30  other things about coffee that we value and rewarding those things, um, but also
33:35  allowing the entire coffee culture, right, from farm all the way to the final cup to kind of get on the same uh
33:42  page, understand the same things about coffee and everybody having the tools to
33:47  really have that language of communication about about quality. Um, is R grading the same as Q-grading? So,
33:54  our grading robusta uh grading it's it's similar um but it's a totally different
34:02  flavor set a totally different scoring system adjusted to robusta right and our
34:08  expectations about robusta um so it is the same in the sense that it's trying
34:14  to establish a language around robusta um coffee um but it's going to look
34:21  really similar but like obviously like the scoring and the language around it will be different but it's the same kind
34:27  of concept. So yeah um are we using the same SCA form
34:33  for the same our grading as well? I'm sorry one more time u are we using the same um sea form for
34:42  our grading as well? No, I believe it's a it's it's like a a
34:47  different form. Um I'm gonna try and pull up a picture of it.
34:53  And robusta grading is actually pretty new like they they just came up with um
35:00  you know a robusta grading form pretty recently I think. Um
35:06  okay compared to is it go like is it again sea or is it different?
35:12  Um that's what I'm trying to I can't remember. Okay. I know that the um world coffee
35:20  research and then oh what is what is that lab called? There's like a sensory
35:27  um focused lab. Um they kind of developed a flavor wheel for Robusta and
35:34  then from that they've created a new a scoring system. Um okay. Okay. But I'm not sure who
35:42  certifies like who certifies uh
35:47  our graders. It might be SCA. I wouldn't be surprised. Um I would think it would
35:53  be SCA, but I am not sure. Okay. Um
36:00  but yeah, they do have a new flavor wheel. It came out last year.
36:08  Yeah, they have their own course, but I'm not sure who certifies. So,
36:13  okay, I'll look at that. But so, yeah. So, the the whoever is assisting should be our grader and it's
36:20  a different Okay. Okay. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
36:25  No problem. Um and then Michael, wasn't there a change? There was a change. Um
36:32  so CQI used to certify QG graders. CQI
36:39  being the coffee quality institute. Um this year the special coffee
36:45  association kind of took over that entire program and they created a new
36:52  cupping form. And really it's like three cupping forms in one. So there's an
36:59  affective tasting form, um, a descriptive tasting form, and then an
37:05  external acting form. So the go the idea was like, let's kind of split out all
37:10  the parts that were on the old score sheet. One form we're just describing, we're not scoring it. One form we're
37:18  going in and scoring it, and they're trying to expand how many numbers you use. And then there's another form where
37:23  you write down exttrinsic attributes, right? Um
37:28  it's basically the same as the old cyping form just separated out on multiple papers and then I guess trying
37:36  to capture extrinsic it attributes. Um
37:42  with that basically has come a whole new set of classes. Everybody who was a QG
37:47  grader has to um retake a new curator test.
37:52  Um, the industry at large is pretty divided on if they like it or not. It
37:59  feels like the same thing that we previously had just dressed up brand
38:04  new, repackaged, and now there's new classes. So, it kind of feels like a money grab. Um, but then other people
38:10  really like this new form. At the end of the day, it's not really like the form that we are using that defines specialty
38:17  coffee, right? It's again it comes down to like you know do our customers like
38:24  it? Do we like it? Do we have a relationship that allows us to buy that
38:30  coffee in a way that feels fair? Um and you know what kind of impact are we
38:37  making with those purchases? Like all of those larger questions outside of just the flavor of the cup are also very very
38:44  important in specialty coffee, right? Um, so this is do previous scores equate to
38:52  new scores? I don't really know. You would like if you scored a coffee the old way in a new
38:59  way. I'm not sure if the scores would be the same or not. They might be the exact
39:04  same. Um, but you know, at the end of the day, it's
39:10  almost like all of it's kind of just made up. We're just making it up. And the the more challenging question is
39:16  like, dude, does the score equate to the price, right, that we're paying for it? Um,
39:22  and you know, not always, right? The goal with this
39:29  was to like capture more information about the coffee and be able to communicate with a producer better. All
39:35  of it's communication, right? When we're describing a coffee, it's communication. When we're scoring a coffee, we're communicating how we feel about it. Um,
39:43  and so, you know, at the end of the day, like again, that score doesn't really define
39:50  specialty coffee. Some people will use the new SCA score sheet. Some people will stick to the old one. I know many
39:56  companies that have their own way of tasting and scoring coffee. We have developed um like an app for uh scoring
40:05  coffee um where we don't score it at all. we just input what we taste and then they'll just descriptors have a
40:11  pre-assigned value to it, right? So like there's a lot of different ways nowadays
40:16  to kind of taste coffee. I think the important thing again is like this point
40:21  about trust and good faith creates connections between producers, buyers, and consumers, right? Especially coffee
40:27  is built on connections. whether you know the producer directly um or if you're going through an
40:34  exporter that works with that producer like in some way specialty coffee is far more connected than the ca market
40:40  coffee. Uh Jorge do you have a question? Yeah, I have a um probably a comment um
40:49  based on the you know the pre the previous uh form for coffee evaluation
40:54  even in the new one as well but I I I'm on the at the end of the chains I am uh
41:01  roster here in Australia uh we import some coffee from Colombia. I'm from Colombia. We have a cafe. So,
41:08  we serve coffee here. But for me, the really important part on this is
41:14  um how do we communicate this to the farmers because you know you want to bring transparency. So the previous form
41:22  it was for some of the farmer they even don't know what you mean with any of this you know
41:28  um in the new form the new format like just came out which is as you say it's
41:34  super confusing. It's like nobody knows anything in reality what's going on. How you going to trade those three forms to
41:41  the origin in a middle of a mountain in Colombia who some to someone who
41:46  probably never had been even in contact with the previous one and now you're going to show up with three papers. It's
41:52  it's a very you know it's a very tricky part to try to be transparent and you
41:58  know is what we are looking for now. be transparent hing a coffee for our
42:04  consumers that they know where come from and they know what the farmers are happy to sell this coffee and not just that
42:12  they selling selling it because they need the money you know all that kind of things. So it will be good in if you
42:18  know the industry come together with something like really help not just the top of the industry but the base of the
42:25  industry that the farmers you know all around the world.
42:30  Yeah, I I completely agree and I I agree with you that the old form it wasn't any
42:35  better than this new form. In fact, the new form maybe just made the old form like a little bit worse, right? Like it
42:41  didn't fix anything like we I don't know people thought it might fix something, but it doesn't fake transparency for
42:48  sure. It does not fix it because to be transparent, basically the person producing coffee
42:55  needs to know what we like and how much we like that thing, right? We need to be
43:00  able to say like lemon is a good flavor note and it's this good to us. So if you
43:06  produce coffee with lemon, like that's worth a good price, right? But like that
43:12  I guess knowing what the consumer values
43:18  um would would make the process more transparent and this doesn't this doesn't help help producers do that um
43:25  whatsoever. And so um I agree with you like the biggest thing really is is
43:31  communication, right? tasting coffee together and communicating what we're tasting together and why we like that um
43:40  is really the only way to make coffee grading transparent, right? Everybody participating in it um and and
43:47  understanding one another. But even that's hard because we have different tastes in different parts of the world,
43:53  right? But um that's like our at least for for us at Cafe Imports, the reason
43:58  we made a new cupping form where we aren't scoring is because if I'm in a good mood one day and I taste orange, I
44:06  might score it high. And then the next day I wake up in a bad mood, I taste the same coffee, the same flavor of orange,
44:12  but I score it low. Right? There's human variance day after day after day that
44:17  we're making decisions about versus like we are tasting and describing and then
44:24  there is a machine in the background that's assigning a score to that flavor note the same way day after day after
44:30  day and that's what we're trying to take to producers to show them like hey this kind of cut profile always scores this
44:37  way. Um, but it's hard. It's it's like again it's one
44:43  of those things where coffee has always been extractive, right? We are extracting this product um from a place
44:50  that is typically underserved, right? And that's what makes coffee challenging
44:56  um to to make fair and transparent. Um I appreciate your comments on that
45:02  for sure. And again, nobody makes the rules. It's not a regulated market, right? there
45:07  really are no rules. Um, so for me, like we can talk about score sheets,
45:15  um, we can talk about flavor, we can talk about certifications even, but
45:21  ultimately specialty coffee comes down to the fact that it's it's an entire culture, right? It's an entire way of
45:27  thinking about a product of culture. You know, if you think about a specific culture, that includes generationally
45:35  built beliefs, values, practices, languages, symbols, um, and all of these
45:41  things kind of shaped how somebody moves throughout the world, right? And so the coffee culture,
45:47  we're very much just learning from one another through osmosis, right? It's industry trends combined with long-held
45:55  beliefs combined with new discoveries combined with different tools and people
46:01  all over the world literally in every corner of the world and all of that is coming together to kind of create the
46:06  coffee industry, right? Um, so that's the other challenge is it's a it's it's
46:11  it's a culture that's constantly changing, right? We're always changing how we think about coffee. So we want to
46:17  make sure that as people, you know, the coffee culture is changing um in a way
46:23  that that supports everybody and it doesn't continue to lift, you know, lift up just the consuming side, right? And
46:31  that's what a lot of people worry this new scoring form does. It continues to just lift the same people that it always
46:37  has and not not all boats, right? So when we get into Green Mine, how is
46:42  coffee actually bought and sold? Um, you know, I I personally didn't when I
46:48  was a first a barista, like understanding how green buying happened.
46:54  Um, I didn't understand how the money actually exchanged for the coffee. So,
46:59  hopefully we'll demystify that if that's a mysterious process at all. Um, and then we'll talk about different
47:06  entities, right? Like who are the different groups at Origin that are selling coffee, right? It's not always
47:12  single farmers selling their coffee. In fact, that's probably the minority of instances, right? Um, and all that kind
47:19  of helps us get an idea of of how many times a coffee is changing hands.
47:24  Who is selling coffee? Who are the producing entities? We have three entities that will kind of group this
47:31  into producers, cooperatives, and exporters.
47:36  A producer um is obviously the grower and harvester
47:41  of a coffee, right? We define um the grower of coffee as a farmer, but
47:48  somebody who grows and processes coffee as a producer. That's just kind of our internal definition at Cafe Imports.
47:55  That's not like an industry-wide thing. But um we do differentiate people
48:00  who grow and then people who grow and process. People who grow their coffee but don't process, right? Farmers, they
48:08  are going to sell their coffee first to a processor in cherry, right? So, they
48:14  have um they have to sell their coffee before it's it's all the way in the seed
48:20  form, right? They are going to sell their coffee to a processor of some sort. We'll talk about different
48:25  processors. somebody who grows and processes their own coffee um are going is going to sell
48:31  their coffee in parchment to a dry mill. Somebody who operates a dry mill. Um and
48:38  then there are some very specific cases where like in Costa Rica for example
48:44  um where they have micro millills, right? Farmers can grow, they process and they mill their own coffee and then
48:52  they get that coffee exported, right? Um so basically producers you know are
48:58  making the choice on what operations they want um to handle or can handle at
49:04  their level and then that determines what choices they have in terms of where and how they're going to sell that
49:11  coffee. No matter what though the price paid back to the producer is called farmgate. Right? When the coffee leaves
49:17  the farm ownership typically transfers. So that's why we call it farmgate. price
49:23  paid to the producer. Farm gate needs to cover the cost of production, the cost of living and include profit, right?
49:32  Um there's a handful of studies out there you can actually read on cost of
49:38  production and cost of living. Again, most farmers live and operate in
49:44  underserved areas in areas where the farmer has not, you know, tracked their cost of production, right? When we're
49:51  talking 20 years ago, almost no coffee producer tracked their cost of production. It was a number we didn't as
49:58  buyers even know, right? We didn't know how much it cost to produce coffee. Um, and so, uh, there are some studies
50:06  coming out about this. Um, which is great. Um, these numbers vary
50:11  drastically country to country. Um, and there have been plenty of seasons where this C market price doesn't come close
50:18  to even making a profit for producers, right? So, largely a lot of coffee has
50:23  been an unprofitable business. Farmgate needs to include farmer profits and that's that's a big a big point of
50:30  emphasis um for the people we work with is understanding like as much as we can
50:37  um what is a living wage in coffee, right? Um so producers. The next group
50:43  is cooperatives or associations. Um this group is um a local business that is
50:50  collectively owned or operated by multiple farmers, right? Working together. Um so obviously distinguishing
50:59  factor here is it's not a single farm, it is a group of producers.
51:04  um working as a group and the reasons we see cooperatives in many areas is
51:09  because as a group that's more coffee right market greater market access um
51:15  you can share knowledge against one another and just centralizing processing or milling um centralizing the logistics
51:23  of shipping that coffee it um less expensive of a process more bulk to work
51:29  with um we've got uh with that member and
51:36  community benefits. So, there are tons of different size cooperatives. I've seen cooperatives that have 15
51:42  producers, right? Um and then there's cooperatives that are like entire micro
51:48  regions, right? Maybe multiple towns um and producers with in between all of those towns, right? Some big and some
51:56  small. Different co-ops might keep their coffee um all separate in different microlots. Some co-ops might blend every
52:03  single producers's coffee together, right? So co-ops can range in size for sure. Um uh in some instances, coffee
52:13  will be purchased from producers in cherry, right? So we talked about there are producers who don't process their
52:19  coffee. They may deliver it to their cooperative where that coffee will then be processed. Some co-ops don't have um
52:26  a way to process coffee. So instead, the producer will process it and then the cooperative will collect that cherry or
52:32  collect that coffee in parchment, right? They'll just collect the seeds. Um and then they'll contract a mill or a dry
52:40  mill to mill that coffee. Um
52:46  then exporters. Exporters also sell coffee, right? Um
52:52  exporters are different because they are a company, right? They're not collectively owned necessarily. They are
52:58  not a group of producers. It is an origin-based company, private or public, right? Owned by the government or just
53:06  um owned privately that focuses on sourcing coffee, right? Um they source
53:12  coffee. They may process that coffee, mill market and export that coffee. Um
53:18  in some countries like like often in East Africa, Ethiopia
53:25  producers farm sizes are so so so small that all the producers
53:31  in those areas are delivering their cherry to one exporter, right? For a long time those exporters were
53:37  governmentrun. They were required um to export through the government system,
53:43  right? And so um there are instances where exporters are always collecting cherry and then they're blending that
53:50  coffee, milling it and bringing it all to market. Um there are also really small exporters that focus on quality,
53:57  right? They will source microlotss and they almost act as a marketing agent for
54:02  that farm, right? So they they keep that coffee separate and they find a few
54:08  buyers for that farm, right? So there are very small ones, there's huge ones.
54:15  Um but the price paid to an exporter by somebody buying their coffee is called
54:20  free on board, right? Free on board or FOB
54:26  um is basically what you are paying the exporter who sourced that coffee, mailed
54:31  it, and then you organize the logistics with them. on board referring to the actual boat that the coffee is shipping
54:38  on. The price we're paying that gets the coffee onto the boat. Um the FOB price
54:45  which might be truck or car the exporter once coffee is loaded onto
54:53  a truck that's going to the port. That's FOT. Um
54:59  that price needs to cover farmgate, right? Farmgate is behind it. and then all the exporters cost and profit.
55:10  So those are kind of like the three group right you've got individual farmers cooperate groups of farmers and
55:18  you got exporters which are sourcing businesses right exporters
55:24  um consuming buyers importers roers and then obviously all that trickles down to the consumer.
55:31  So importers like us, cafe imports, we are companies that are kind of similar
55:36  to exporters just on the opposite end of the supply chain, right? Focus on sourcing coffee um purchasing that
55:43  coffee and handling all the shipping logistics and that coffee before we then
55:49  get that coffee to the right. Um importers like exporters like co-ops,
55:55  they can range from super big, super small operations. they can offer a huge range of quality. Um uh the the kind of
56:05  I guess upside that importers have is they often have more capital to buy more coffee. They can um a bunch of coffee
56:14  together in a shipping container for more cost-effective shipping. Um and like an exporter or a co-op, they often
56:21  provide services to roasters and or farmers, right? social programs,
56:27  purchasements and flexibility options. Um we often finance um a farmer's
56:34  harvest before the harvest is started. Um things like that, right? The price paid to an importer is called X works or
56:42  X warehouse. So the price paid to the importer is what gets the coffee to
56:47  leave the importer's warehouse and move to the roster. So roasters
56:57  Right. They also focus on sourcing, whether that be from origin party or from an importer. Then roast, package
57:04  and sell that coffee. Um, wholesale retail, right? And that's the price we pay to a roster, the retail price. Um,
57:12  roasters, they are consumerf faced party, right? They are kind of the educators, the taste makers. and kind of
57:20  develop um where coffee culture goes within their communities, right? Um the
57:26  retail price obviously needs to give the roster their profit and operate roers business expenses and then it also has
57:33  built into it farmgate, FOB and Xworks if they bought it from an importer.
57:45  So, um,
57:52  guys, consider importing coffee to Australia. You know, we I don't know if
57:58  we've ever had a Chinese coffee at Cafe Imports. We've recently purchased in like Vietnam. Um, I I have personally
58:06  been to China and had Chinese coffee um and met some Chinese farmers and I've
58:11  had some good coffee from there. But uh you know we've never found a connection in China um with like enough coffee to
58:19  buy. But uh we are always open to samples. You can always send samples to our Australia office. Um we have an
58:26  Australia cafe imports office. Um and we sample everything we get.
58:34  So going through the flowchart here, a producer may sell their coffee to a
58:39  cooperative. They may sell their coffee to an exporter or directly to an importer or roaster, right? Um, and they
58:48  might be selling their coffee in cherry or in parchment to a cooperative or exporter. If they're selling to a
58:55  importer or a roaster directly, the producer and the importer party will
59:02  license out um an ex, you know, somebody to mill that coffee, right? they'll work
59:07  with an exporter and um get that exporter under contract to help move that coffee. Um but they would not be
59:14  considered, you know, the person selling the importer of the coffee, right? If that money gets wired directly to a
59:19  producer, that is more of a a direct um purchase, what we I guess we refer to as
59:25  as direct in the industry, right? Um so wherever that money is getting wired,
59:30  that kind of defines what kind of purchase it is. Uh cooperatives, they sell to importers or roasters and
59:37  exporters um sell to importers or roasters. Uh roasters have the whole world of
59:45  options, right? They can buy from any of the parties preceding them. Um importers sell to roast, roasters
59:54  sell to consumers. Pretty straightforward. But um when we talk
1:00:00  about traceability, right? Um, a roaster buying coffee from an importer, they may
1:00:07  or may not know the FOB and the farmgate price, right? The roster may or may not
1:00:13  know. An importer buying from an exporter, they know the FOB, but depending on the exporter and the amount
1:00:19  of information that exporter gathers, they may not know farmgate, right? Um, similarly with cooperative. With
1:00:26  cooperative, you get a little bit closer. Usually cooperatives have more documentation of what they pay to
1:00:31  producers. So you might know farmgate, but then working with a producer, you definitely know the farmgate price,
1:00:37  right? So the deeper and deeper roasters and importers source, usually the higher
1:00:43  clarity they have into who is getting paid what, right? Um so retail,
1:00:52  Xworks, free on board, farmgate. So now we kind of get into how prices
1:00:59  are set in transparency. Um it all starts with the C market, right? Um specialty coffee, we refer to
1:01:08  it as differentiated, right? Um the differential is the gap between what we
1:01:15  paid for a coffee and what the C market price was at the time, right? So in 2024, the average C price was $2.35 a
1:01:23  pound. And this is just an example of like 80 to 83 point coffee might be 20
1:01:30  cents over C price. 84 to 85 might be $3. So4 65 cents over seed price. This
1:01:39  86 range you start to get $4.5 right multiple dollars over the seed price.
1:01:45  And then 90 point plus sky is the limit. You might have just heard that the best of Panama coffee sold for almost
1:01:52  $500,000. Like a lot of coffee. I can't remember how much that broke to per pound, but an
1:01:59  insane number, right? Half a million dollars for a lot of coffee. Um and so,
1:02:06  uh specialty coffee, um at the low end, the C market will impact
1:02:14  the price. Yeah, there you go. Insane. Um,
1:02:19  you know, if a producer is delivering their coffee to, let's say, a large,
1:02:26  um, then that co-op typically posts every day
1:02:34  like, hey, if you deliver cherry today, this is what you will be paid per pound
1:02:39  or pin tall or per whatever unit of measurement, right? And that price fluctuates with the C market when we're
1:02:45  talking about kind of that 83.85 84 point coffee. But as the coffee gets higher in quality, that C market becomes
1:02:52  a little more subconscious in terms of how it impacts price. Right? So that's a cup quality differential. We
1:03:00  also pay premiums um for social programs, right? We have a woman
1:03:05  producer program, cocoa substitution program, um you know, programs for
1:03:13  conservation of land, those kinds of things, right? So premiums might get paid for that and then coffees that are
1:03:19  certified are also right. All of this contributes to the differential or the amount paid above the C market price. Um
1:03:28  but again remembering that the C market is 90 to 95% of coffee, right? And highly
1:03:36  fluctuating. Um and especially coffee is that top 5 to 10% again 80 point coffee heavily
1:03:42  impacted less so and barely impacted way up there right um
1:03:51  so typically like when we're working with an exporter
1:03:57  the exporter might say three point coffees this is the
1:04:02  differential we are asking for those coffees right um all 86 six they're
1:04:08  getting differential over the C market price and then microllets are not
1:04:14  necessarily a differential but rather we are just saying this puppy
1:04:19  is pound right um and so that's where
1:04:24  like when we are buying from all the way from producers to co-ops or exporters there are usually kind of agreed upon
1:04:31  premiums based on the score of the coffee and then extra premiums for any
1:04:36  social programs if that makes sense. Um I'm not sure. Let's skip through these
1:04:42  and kind of get here some transparency stuff. So, oh, so the coffee buying timeline, how
1:04:50  we actually go about buying coffee at Cafe Imports. Let's make a cooperative.
1:04:56  Um that cooperative has a mill, right? They are basically storing all of their coffee. They are pulling samples from
1:05:04  that coffee and they are green grading those samples, roasting them, cupping
1:05:10  them themselves and then sending us samples. Right? So, we're receiving this sample called an offer. We will cup the
1:05:17  offer and then we'll say we want to buy it, right? A contract will be drafted
1:05:22  and signed um saying that we intend to buy that coffee. The coffee will then be
1:05:28  mil, right? So, the coffee will go through its milling. It'll be sorted and then bagged into its JW bags. Um, a
1:05:34  sample will be pulled from that mil coffee, sent to us called a pre-ship sample, and we approve that sample. Once
1:05:42  that sample is approved, then we book all of the routing for the coffee, right? So, trucking the coffee to port,
1:05:48  getting that coffee out, getting that coffee to its importing uh port, and then we will handle trucking of coffee
1:05:56  to our warehouse. Right. But after we approve the PSS, the pre-ship sample, we
1:06:02  make that booking. The coffee is then loaded onto a truck, delivered to port,
1:06:08  ownership transfers to us once that um coffee is on the boat and the boat
1:06:13  departs. The invoice for the coffee and shipping documents are then sent to us
1:06:20  by the exporter and we turn pay that invoice off. Right? So that is called a
1:06:27  cash against documents system. Sometimes banks can be involved where basically
1:06:33  you know the documents and invoice are sent to a bank. The bank holds it. We send the money to our bank and the bank
1:06:42  everything gets disseminated back to the the buyer and seller. Um
1:06:47  uh but this is typically how we buy coffee. We don't really ever have banks involved. Um, we work with people that
1:06:54  that we trust, right? We're not worried about somebody running off with product or running off with money. Um,
1:07:02  cool. So, what is transparency? We've had some talks about transparency um already, but transparency is the
1:07:08  gathering and sharing of information, right? Better understand our impact of
1:07:13  our business decisions, right? When we think about coffee, we often think about
1:07:19  like how much is every party getting and is it a fair price? Um well price based
1:07:28  on what, right? Um there are many ways to measure impact,
1:07:35  right? We can say we're paying a producer. Well, that would be financial impact. Um but there's also we try and
1:07:42  measure our social impact and environmental impact right um for cafe
1:07:48  imports we want to know that we are paying farmers well we are paying our employees well um that we are making
1:07:55  social impact right and that we were we are also being aware of like how much stress we're putting on the environment
1:08:01  right there's a lot of ways to measure impact with transparency um there's a lot of ways we can measure
1:08:08  it that we often don't even think about Um uh but as we've grown in especially
1:08:15  coffee um and as we as a business um we are trying to implement more detailed
1:08:21  transparency. Um and it's important to to do our best to measure impact, right?
1:08:28  Um without basically doxing everybody along the supply chain, right? Um so the
1:08:36  big point here is like oftent time as roasters, our customers want to know how
1:08:42  much did the farmer make, right? As we've seen today, there are a lot of hands that coffee goes through and the
1:08:49  roaster doesn't always know farmgate price. The roster doesn't always know
1:08:55  FOB price, right? Depending on how they bought that coffee. If a roaster buys a coffee from a farmer, they know the
1:09:02  farmgate. In that situation, maybe the roaster can tell the customer what they
1:09:08  pay for that coffee, right? and how much of that payment actually went to the
1:09:14  producer. But in many situations like Ethiopia where all coffee goes
1:09:20  through an exporter basically, nobody really knows what the farmgate prices. It's not documented.
1:09:27  So for a customer buying a really nice Ethiopia, sometimes there's friction there of like, wow, I'm paying 20 to 25
1:09:35  USD for this bag of coffee, but you guys don't even know how much you paid the
1:09:40  farmer. There can be some friction there, right? Um, and that's why, you know, explaining how financial
1:09:47  transparency doesn't fully paint the whole picture is is kind of tough, right? Because
1:09:53  consumers want to know. Um and so I think with
1:09:59  rampant production of product in the world, we've also received the means to
1:10:05  kind of see the effect of that production. So consumers and even
1:10:10  roasters and importers uh we want to know that our purchases
1:10:15  are having positive impacts, right? And like I've said already in this class is that can be challenging in
1:10:22  producers under serve in coffee. So um
1:10:28  coffee has this this this weird situation where consumer back there's more um pressure
1:10:37  being applied to producers to collect data right like how much are you paying
1:10:44  your employees how are you growing um how much to grow that coffee this
1:10:51  year you paid for all of the cost year what are the breakdown of the price per
1:10:57  lot, right? You can get to see how asking a producer to provide all that information.
1:11:02  Um, it's an unequal position of power, right? Some producers are very excited
1:11:09  to share that information. Um, and that's that's great. And some other
1:11:15  producers do not want to share that information for a number of reasons, right? Um just like importers or
1:11:21  worsters may or may not share a bunch of information, but um
1:11:28  finding ways to share information about the supply chain and our impact um is
1:11:33  really important and it's you know there's a lot of different ways this can
1:11:39  happen. you know, like third-party verification, things like BC Corp or I
1:11:45  know there's some other businesses out there that are doing third-party verification of people's practices. Um,
1:11:51  this is a chart where basically every country we purchased in, we tried to do research and figure out what was the
1:11:57  average specialty price premium above the C market. Um, and then we evaluated
1:12:04  our prices and adjusted them based on that, right? trying to pay above the
1:12:09  average specialty price. This is a good way to display information without um
1:12:14  you know divulging too much private data. Um ultimately coffee needs to
1:12:21  better understand the cost of production by region, right? That would be the next best model is like if we know the cost
1:12:27  of production by region, then we can accurately um try and place our premiums paid in
1:12:35  that context, right? we can look at the living income in specific geographic areas. That's that's what coffee kind of
1:12:42  needs, but ultimately we're not always paying the producer directly, right? Um
1:12:49  so the big thing for us when it comes to transparency is we are often pressured to try and provide as much data as
1:12:56  possible. In some cases, we don't know everything about that coffee and where
1:13:01  it came from. Um, and you know, the goal of transparency
1:13:07  of transparency is to achieve more accountability, right? Our biggest thing is we're not trying to basically audit
1:13:13  our partners. Um, but rather we're trying to understand who our uh
1:13:20  exporters we work with, who they are, what their goals are, what they're trying to do in their communities, and
1:13:25  finding people who align with our values. Right? Going back to specialy coffee, that's often what it's about.
1:13:31  finding people who align with your values. Um, and trusting that this is a
1:13:36  fair exchange and that um, they are treating the people they work with behind
