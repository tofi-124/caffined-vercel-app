0:00  So today's class is building on part five, yesterday's class which was called
0:06  coffee is a science. The sixth part, coffee is an art. Um we've heard these terms before, right? We've heard
0:12  roasting called a science and an art or brewing. But to that end, farming, processing, every single aspect of the
0:19  seed to cup supply chain is a science. It is an art. Um and we're going to kind
0:25  of get into what that means, right? What is art? Um, I could have you answer this question in
0:32  the chat. We might get a lot of like different kinds of answers because art is like obviously deeply important to
0:39  culture. It's been around forever. Um, and lots of things qualify as art. With
0:45  that in mind, I really like this first definition. Art is a skill that is a result of learning or practice. We
0:52  talked about yesterday how science is a discipline. It is it is learning,
0:58  right? Science is learning. And so art is like a skill you kind of gain because
1:05  of that learning, right? Or practice. All of us in coffee have to learn many things and practice things over and over
1:11  to get good at it, right? Um an occupation requiring knowledge or skill,
1:17  right? We call coffee an occupation. It's an industry. It's my livelihood. Um but it requires a lot of knowledge and
1:23  skill, right? um the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the
1:29  production of a work um and so there's creativity involved along with that
1:34  skill and that learning right and I I absolutely believe in coffee um at least
1:40  in my personal experience when I was like exploring manual brewing for example it was a lot of trying new
1:46  things creativity trying something I never I didn't know if it would work and seeing what the result is right and
1:52  through that process um through applying your creativity to it, you learn more.
1:57  You see the outcome and you can take that whether conscious or subconscious into the next brew. Same thing I've
2:03  heard with processing, right? As a producer dials in their processing method, it is very much um
2:10  experimentation that hones the skill that teaches us things and we get better
2:15  and better and better at it. Today we apply the art concept to roasting and
2:21  brewing. All right. So, let's quickly review what we talked about yesterday. Yesterday,
2:28  um, coffee is a science was all about kind of evaluating coffee, right? So, green coffee, how we evaluate it and its
2:35  physical characteristics and then all of its kind of uh compounds and how we
2:41  evaluate those via cupping, right? How they interact with us in a flavor way.
2:46  And so, we looked at density, screen size, moisture content, defect uh count. We looked at the compounds within
2:52  coffee, how they relate to flavor, um, and how flavor relates to us as humans. Today, we're now going to apply these
2:59  things, um, to basically how does all of this interact in a roaster, right? And
3:04  then how does all of that interact in a brewer. So, we're going to see how these compounds transform in a roaster. Um,
3:12  and then what compounds in the roasted coffee are being extracted in a brewer. Right? This might be an area maybe we're
3:18  more familiar with if we work for a roastery, if we work in the consuming side. Um, so a lot of it might be
3:26  review, but again, hopefully there's a new way to think about things if it is all information, you know, right? Just
3:31  hearing it presented hopefully a little bit differently. So that's the question. How do all those compounds transform in
3:37  roasting? And then how are those compounds extracted in brewing? Right? Pretty
3:44  simple. Um, this class is a little a little shorter of all of them, but I
3:49  hope it is beneficial. So, here's the objectives for today. We will learn how green coffee interacts with the coffee
3:55  roaster. And that's kind of taking those physical attributes and looking at like how are they physically working with
4:02  heat, right? How do we control the heat transfer? Um, then the difference
4:07  between sample and production roasting. We'll dive into that a little bit more building off of yesterday. what
4:13  compounds are present in roasted coffee, right? The transformation from green to roasted, what happens to those
4:18  compounds, and then fundamentals of coffee extraction. Today's not a how-to class necessarily, right? I'm not
4:25  demoing roasting. I'm personally not like a master coffee roaster. Um, so I
4:31  can't, you know, tell you like if you do this, you'll always get this kind of thing. Um, and similarly with brewing,
4:37  I'm not trying to go so deep into like creating a recipe or using a V60 versus
4:43  a Kita versus an origami or, you know, something like that. Um, so it's not necessarily a how-to class. It's more of
4:50  a like the kind of theory um that we need to learn to enable that more artistic side to come out, right? Um,
4:57  when we get really really good at the fundamentals, then we can kind of branch out and make it our own. So that's what
5:02  we're looking at here. Cool. Let's get into it. If you have any questions, again, interrupt me, please.
5:10  So, let's start out with roasting. What is coffee roasting? We touched on it a little bit yesterday, but today we're
5:16  diving in a little bit deeper. These two classes were kind of weird to to divide up. Roasting is the intentional
5:22  application of heat to create physical and chemical changes in coffee. Right?
5:28  So, going from green coffee to roasted coffee, tons of physical changes happen.
5:33  Tons of chemical changes happen. We're going to look at both of those. We're also going to look at the intentional
5:39  application of heat, right? So, we're going to look at all of it. Roster parts. Let's look at the parts. There
5:44  are so many kinds of roasters nowadays. Um, this is what you would call like a drum roaster. Um, these might be like
5:51  kind of the most common in production roasting you might see. Um, but nowadays there are more and more and more
5:56  technologies coming out um for coffee roasting. But we'll kind of go over these general parts. the hopper. That's
6:02  where the coffee falls into, right? And you get it into the drum. Um the chaff
6:08  collector. This is kind of like a vacuum that pulls the chaff out of the drum roaster, right? Um so as we're roasting
6:16  the silver skin, that last little thin layer on the seed, sometimes that silver skin makes it um to the roaster, the
6:24  chaff collector pulls that out and stores it so it doesn't catch on fire. The trier is that little thing that you
6:30  can pull out and kind of look at the seeds as they're roasting. It catches coffee as it's getting tossed up in the
6:36  drum. Control panel is where you control everything. Um this is the little
6:42  chamber where these burners are, right? Um so burners literally, it could be
6:47  open flame or um electrical heat, some kind of heat um is basically heating up
6:54  that drum surface. um the drum itself. And then let's see,
7:02  cooling tray. That's where the coffee falls and cools down really, really quickly. And then back here, we can't
7:08  really see it, but there's a fan and that controls, you know, the air circulation within the drum. I need to
7:14  add that label. I just realized I forgot it. So, those are all our parts and pieces, right? we are manipulating all
7:20  of these things um in order to roast the coffee and ch make changes during the
7:25  roast of the coffee. Right? So, here's some technical specs. There's different kinds of roasters. Again, this is um uh
7:33  a drum roaster, but there's one called fluid bed or hot air roasters. It uses air and shoots it up into um the coffee
7:40  and kind of tosses the seeds around. So, it's mostly hot air that roasts it.
7:46  versus a drum roaster is a spinning drum. The drum is being directly heated
7:51  by a um energy source and that's doing most some of the roasting of the coffee,
7:57  right? Um fluid beds are not as common. Like you're not going to go to a roaster and see as many fluid bed roasters, but
8:03  um there are some massive fluid bed or hot air roasters out there um that you'll see at like larger companies for
8:10  sure. There's also some tiny sample roasters that are fluid bed. Uh there
8:15  are electric or gas roasters, right? So gas, your actual burning um to heat up
8:22  the drum. Um and then there's electric burners as well. And then capacity will range from tiny tiny little 50 gram
8:29  sample roasters like you can kind of see on the Aawa behind me or there's huge
8:35  huge 50 kilo 100 kil like insanely big coffee roasters at again those massive
8:42  companies um that are stocking our grocery store shelves right um so capacity range um is huge
8:49  sensors some other things I don't have labeled right and these are um basically
8:54  data points. Some roasters may have all of these. Some roasters may only have a handful of these. But the things we are
9:01  trying to um track during a roast, which we'll talk about next, um we can only
9:07  track those if we have a sensor. So the bean temp sensor, it's like a literal temper uh temperature probe that's
9:14  amongst the coffee beans. The inlet temperature, right? So the uh temperature of the heat coming into
9:20  contact with the drum, the inlet, the drum temp itself, um the exhaust temperature,
9:28  um the hopper temperature, uh the airflow velocity and volume can be
9:35  tracked, pressure within the drum can be tracked. Some have cracked detections,
9:40  right? So sound detectors that tell you when first crack or second crack um is
9:45  happening. There's tons of sensors that could uh that could go onto a coffee roaster to kind of give you more data
9:51  points. Um and then obviously like uh the environmental temperature within the
9:57  drum, right? So that's a little different than the drum itself. I could even add that sensor in there. It's trying to get the ambient temperature or
10:03  that airflow temperature inside of the drum. So
10:08  I think of roasters like an oven, right? Or like some sort of cooking thing. Um,
10:15  everything that cooks something has a bunch of different temperatures going on. Even the ambient temperature outside
10:21  of the roster is going to have an impact. The temperature of the coffee before it ever comes into contact with
10:27  the roster changes, right? That's going to change how it cooks. Um, so we kind of take this analogy of cooking and we
10:33  move it forward now. Um, and we kind of apply coffee to it, right? Um, so
10:40  whenever something is being cooked or heated, um, there's a few different ways
10:46  heat can transfer, right? And this was part of that that definition of roasting. First, you have conduction,
10:52  which is basically surfaces touching, right? Um, heat transfer through direct
10:58  contact. So, this is the drum wall of the roster. We're pretending when a seed
11:04  touches the wall of the drum, it's gaining heat. And when those hot seeds touch one another, they also gain heat.
11:11  Right? So heat transfer through direct contact. There is convection transfer. This is
11:19  air. Right? So heat transfer through the movement of liquids or gases. Right? So
11:28  um basically the difference here is it's not direct direct contact between two objects but there is a medium between
11:36  two object that allows a heat to transfer right so air getting hotter and then transferring that heat to the
11:42  actual objects right um so conduction
11:49  uh maybe more like think of like copper wires um convection think of like water
11:55  boiling Right? Heat moving um through water and the molecules speeding up
12:01  eventually creating a boil. And then radiation is heat transfer um through
12:06  electromagnetic waves. No medium is necessary, right? Heat traveling from the sun to the earth is radiation heat
12:13  transfer. Um there are different heating elements like infrared heating elements
12:20  um uh that are used to heat roasters in some kinds of roasters. It's different than an open flame, right? Um, but yeah,
12:28  this is just electromagnetic waves heating up the coffee. Um, and this is also involved to a degree. We are
12:34  basically when we are roasting coffee trying to control all of these at once.
12:40  Um, and how quickly the seeds are absorbing heat, right? So, it's all about how hot are these seeds getting
12:48  over x amount of time. We call this the roast curve. So all the pieces of the
12:54  roster combined with the sensors that are reading out information tell us give
13:00  us a picture of what is happening inside of the roster when we put that coffee into the hot drum. So temperature right
13:09  this is in Fahrenheit over time. Um this maxed out over here is like 11 minutes.
13:14  Up here we've got 525. Um but this is what we call the roast curve, right? Um this is, you know, in a
13:23  sense the temperature of the coffee um over time. You're always going to kind of see this pattern to it, right? Um
13:32  basically spread it out a little bit here. You've
13:37  got charge temp, which is the temperature that the roster is at when you put the coffee in. What we see here
13:44  is a drop in temperature. basically um the seed is absorbing a lot of heat. So
13:51  the temperature probe reads out a decrease in temperature. The seed is obviously gaining temperature during
13:58  this time, right? Um but when you drop all this room temp coffee in, the heat gets zapped out of that kind of like
14:05  roaster environment. it's being absorbed into the coffee and eventually the coffee gets hot enough to where it
14:12  reaches an equilibrium kind of with the environment and then you know the sensor starts tracking an increase in
14:18  temperature rather than a decrease. So it's kind of an equilibrium point of coffee reaches an equilibrium with the
14:24  environment in terms of temperature. Now we can start to increase in temp. Right? The coffee gains momentum and now it
14:31  really starts cooking. Right? That's why we set a pan to hot and then we set the
14:37  thing in it. Um, we set like like an egg. You put it on a hot pan. If you put an egg on a cold pan and then start
14:43  heating it, it takes much much much longer. Right? So, the charge temp is a big variable. We can adjust, right?
14:50  That's the zero second marker when we drop the coffee in and then the the the
14:55  the time starts, right? So, that's our turning point. Once that um seed starts
15:03  gaining some momentum, this whole phase of roasting, the coffee is still pretty
15:08  green is called the drying phase. There's lots of names for these different phases, but basically there's
15:14  lots of moisture in the coffee. That moisture is escaping, right? As we're starting to cook it, the cellular
15:20  structure starts to expand a little bit. We'll go over in detail what each phase does. This point is called the color
15:28  change. Again, different temperature, different roast profiles or recipes are
15:33  going to have different time markers for these. But you can see this color change um occurs right around 375° here and the
15:42  coffee starts turning yellow. This is called the mired or browning phase or yellowing for some people. Again,
15:48  different terms for different um different people. Uh but the coffee starts to yellow. Chemical changes are
15:55  really starting to occur. First crack is when the coffee basically the cells have
16:01  expanded so much due to the release of CO2 and moisture, right? It's kind of
16:07  like popcorn popping. The cells are heated and they start to expand to the point where the coffee actually makes a
16:13  cracking sound. You can hear it coming from the roaster. Um, so yeah, it's kind of like that
16:20  point when popcorn seeds get hot enough and they all start popping. That's kind of like first crack for roasting.
16:27  Anything beyond first crack is called development. Development phase is what
16:32  it sounds like. We are developing more flavor. We are changing the coffee. First crack and development is where the
16:39  most um impactful changes happen when it comes to flavor. Development is referred
16:45  to as a percentage of the total roast time. Right? So 5% development is hardly
16:53  anything past first crack versus 12, 15, 20% development, right? How much of the
16:59  total roast time is the development phase given? At a certain point, second
17:05  crack, you'll hear the seeds crack again. And this is where things really start to actually break down. Oils
17:11  secrete to the outside. And this is what super dark roasted coffee looks like, right? It's oily because all the lipids
17:17  and oils travel to the outside due to the heat. You hear another crack which is just more cellular structure
17:24  breakdown, right? Um so that's second crack and then you can go on and on and
17:29  on to where you've basically burnt out every compound within the coffee just about um or burned the compounds within
17:36  coffee. Right? So again, it's like cooking raw. Now it's actually starting to transform. Now we are cooking and
17:44  caramelizing and now we're starting to burn. Right? So here's some more bulletointed details
17:51  of like what's going on. Drying phase coffee is still green. It's the evaporation of free moisture. Some
17:57  expansion. Um chlorophyll starts to break down and that's why you start to see color change. Um and the cellular
18:05  structure starts to soften the mired when things start yellowing. the
18:10  formation of brown melanoidins that causes the color change. More dehydration, CO2 begins forming um and
18:17  the cell walls continue to break down and caramelization is kind of starting
18:22  to get going. We're starting to see some molecular changes, right? First crack, biggest physical change, steam and CO2
18:28  build up and they release. That's what pops. Um that's what breaks the cell walls. Uh the rest of that silver skin
18:35  separates and comes off. um volatile compound formation and then uh
18:40  throughout development that's where you get some big volume increase um and a lot of weight loss um right coffee has
18:48  lost a lot of its moisture and it's becoming less and less and less dense um oils will start to move toward the outer
18:55  surface um more CO2 production from cooking um and yeah you'll increase the
19:01  porocity of the coffee so development time is really kind of like where the magic happens especially when it comes
19:07  to specialty coffee, right? We're going to discuss um discuss those transformations of
19:14  compounds here in just a minute. So, sample roasting. Let's see. If we have
19:20  any questions, let me know. I know I'm kind of just rolling rolling rolling, but um
19:26  sample roasting. So, let's talk about sample verse production, right? This is just kind of a a general
19:32  um uh a general roast profile. the general three phases that's happening,
19:39  right? We talked about sample roasting some yesterday, how it's supposed to be standardized. Well, the question is,
19:45  well, you've got seeds of different shapes, different processes, they're going to absorb heat differently, right?
19:50  Like, you can't ever do the exact same roast twice hardly, right? No matter
19:57  what, it's a new moment. Some variable is going to be different, which is ultimately going to change that final
20:03  outcome. So when we talk about a standardized roast and sample roasting,
20:08  right, we're trying to roast as consistently as possible. The way we approach this is basically changing as
20:16  little of the variables um possible, right? We want to not mess
20:22  with too many of the variables that are at our disposal. So here's a more fleshed out roast profile. All of these
20:28  curves are different sensors. Um and I'll zoom in on those. And then this is like your your power or your gas um and
20:37  your airflow. And uh I think
20:42  I can't remember what this last one is there's three lines down here, but air
20:48  flow and and power or heat um are the big ones down here, right? You can
20:53  adjust those things all through the roast. And you're going to see those adjustments reflected in these data
20:59  points. Right? Whenever we sample roast, we are basically setting our charge
21:05  temp, right? We're getting all of those settings where we want them, dropping the coffee in at the exact temperature
21:12  possible, and then we essentially just let that coffee ride. This red line is
21:17  the coffee. Um, we don't change our fan settings. We don't change our power
21:22  settings. We're not going to change the RPM of the drum. Um, we are just going to let that coffee go and then basically
21:31  right after first crack, um, which is this line right here, um, we drop that
21:38  coffee pretty quickly. You can see it's a 9.3% development time, right? Not very
21:45  much development time. That's very, very little. All of these little bars right
21:51  here, those are all cracking sounds. Um, so you can see not long after all
21:58  the cracking is done, we drop it. We have a rule of like once you hear less than two pops per 5 seconds, we drop the
22:05  coffee. So a sample roast is super light. Um, and that's kind of the deal. This is a
22:12  this is a chart from our roast roasters. R O E S T. Um, they have so many sensors
22:19  in them. It's really really cool. That's what we roast uh most all of our samples on um uh at least right now, right? So,
22:28  um this is an actual real sample roast of ours.
22:34  Production roasting the rule of change as little as possible goes out the
22:39  window, right? This is where we are actually manipulating the available roasting variables to achieve the
22:45  product, right? Your desired flavor profile, right? And often this is roasting in larger increments. This is
22:52  coffee that's going into a retail bag or a white label bag or on the bar. Um this
22:58  these are roasts where we are actually starting to manipulate things. Right here's some of the big stuff we watch or
23:05  we can manipulate. Again, I'm not a master roaster. I could get an an actual roaster in here and they could kind of
23:11  go through all this in far better detail than I. But again, you can change the drop temp. Um, you can mess with the fan
23:19  settings uh throughout the roast, right? If you want more or less air flow during
23:25  a certain phase, right? More kind of like hot air moving through the roster
23:30  is going to affect the coffee differently. Changing the amount of power you are applying to the roast,
23:36  right? Um, so here's the gray bar and these are changes in power that are
23:42  happening um during the roast to kind of like, you know, figure out where you
23:48  want it uh where you want it to go. Inlet temperature. Again, this is something that that people are um paying
23:55  more and more attention to. Not as many roasters back in the day had sensors on on the um the the roasting on the heat
24:03  entering the roast chamber. Um, but this is kind of an independent variable um
24:08  that can help ensure consistency um right, especially when the environment you're in is um changing
24:14  ambient temperatures, right? A hotter environment will typically create a hotter inlet temp. So being able to kind
24:20  of um keep that the same is is helpful or you know having a target for it. And
24:26  then something that's often watched is this rate of rise. the rate of rise um is essentially the
24:33  speed at which the coffee beans um are changing temperature, right? So coffee
24:40  is changing temperature pretty drastically through this first green phase, right? And you can see that
24:47  that's pretty high, but then near the end, we want to kind of slow that temperature change down. So you see the
24:53  rate of rise start to really really drop, right? Um this is typically measured in degrees per minute. Um, and
25:00  that's a good indicator of what's to come in the roast, right? It kind of helps you guess what's about to happen
25:06  and make changes to either avoid too much temperature change or increase some
25:11  power to keep that momentum going with temperature change. I saw a question just come up. Go ahead and ask it,
25:17  please. Yes, it's Lauren. Lauren,
25:22  I've noticed many roasters who are seller and
25:27  the f
25:33  I think I just lost you. I do hear an echo when you're asking questions.
25:41  Oh, I don't hear you now.
25:50  See? Well, feel free to drop it in the chat if something is not working, but I can't hear you right now, Lawrence.
25:56  Sorry about that. But yeah, put it in the chat and I'll answer I'll answer your question for
26:01  sure. Um, cool. Anything else right here? Again, I'm not like
26:08  the biggest or like the best roster out there, but Oh, Lawrence, I see you. You can ask away, please, if you would like.
26:34  Alrighty. Um, Lawrence, I'll keep an eye out if your question comes up. Sorry about that. Um,
26:43  so let's see here. We've got that's kind of rose profile basics.
26:50  Um, and I think the thing I would want to take away from this portion of the class is the reason we talked about
26:57  physical attributes in the class before this is because all of those are so so
27:02  so important when it comes to roasting coffee, right? Again, like think of it
27:09  as cooking. Something that is smaller is going to cook faster than something that is bigger, right? Screen size. large
27:17  seeds take um potentially longer to heat versus small seeds um tend to heat up
27:25  much faster, right? Um and so the problem you encounter here, particularly
27:31  like with large seed, is that the outside gets hotter much sooner than the inside. So if you roast a big coffee
27:40  seed too fast, you will might scorch the outside, but the inside will still be
27:45  raw, right? Just like cooking. You can sear something, but the inside might not
27:51  be cooked all the way. So then you have to finish it in the oven, right? Versus a longer, slower, less aggressive
27:57  heating is going to work better for something that is larger, right? So different development and total roast
28:03  times for different sizes and obviously huge variance in seed size is extremely
28:09  hard to roast consistently. Right? If you got a bunch of big, a bunch of tiny and a bunch of medium seeds in there,
28:14  they are going to roast all at different rates, right? So screen size. Um having
28:20  a a consistent size is very helpful. moisture content. High moisture seeds um
28:26  they might spend more time in the first phase, right, before you start to see color change um versus low moisture
28:33  seeds uh is going to be a much shorter roast, right? You can scorch them much
28:38  quicker. They will roast much faster, more naturally. But moisture and size
28:45  all kind of relate to density too, right? like a high density seed, something that is it could be smaller
28:52  but super dense might be more resistant to heat penetration, right? Um but there
28:59  are big seeds that might be super dense as well. Density is is often a product of um elevation and processing can have
29:06  an impact on how dense that coffee seed is, the cellular structure, and just how much stuff is in there, right? So
29:12  knowing the density of your coffee um you know can kind of inform how
29:19  quickly your coffee might roast, right? Um low density seeds, they're going to
29:25  want to gain momentum in the roast curve super fast. So you have to kind of control how quickly you're allowing that
29:32  burning to happen, right? Your energy source, you're going to have to really kind of control that. Um and then defect
29:38  count, right? there's a bunch of defects, you know, pre- or post sorting may be helpful. Um, and these can cause
29:44  roasting inconsistencies as well, right? So, somebody who's super accomplished in
29:50  roasting, they've become so familiar with these variables, different seeds, different
29:57  countries, different processes that they might have different starting points or different kind of profiles or recipes in
30:05  mind for those coffees. Right? somebody who has turned roasting into a science
30:10  and an art form, really really knows how to handle different coffees, or at least where to start with, but then the only
30:16  way to continue to dial in that roast profile is to roast it, taste it, roast
30:23  it, taste it, roast it, taste it. Right? Dialing in the perfect roast comes down to what does it taste like? Therefore,
30:30  what adjustments do I need to make? Do I need more or less development? Do I need to get to development sooner or later?
30:36  Right. Um, and so you will control the power or fuel, you will control the fan.
30:43  Um, you may change the drum RPM, but you'll kind of adjust all of those
30:48  settings uh to get all these different ideal starting temperatures and then the rate
30:55  at which things change, right? The rate of rise throughout the roast based on that coffee. Lawrence, um, no problem.
31:01  I'm sorry about the volume. Um, any observation on the overall quality of a cup when roasted on a sample roster like
31:07  the Iawa versus on a conventional drum roaster? Great question. There are so many roers nowadays, right? There's so
31:14  many of these small technologydriven roasties uh roasters coming out. Like if
31:20  you go to a big, you know, sea expo um or World of Coffee, you're going to see
31:26  all these brands, right? Um we used to roast on your uh
31:34  conventional drum roaster. Um but that comes to more you have to like
31:40  manually track your temperature over time. We did have to make one airflow adjustment mid roast for our sample
31:46  roasts. Um nowadays you get something like an AWA and they're much more automated. Um you can tell it to do the
31:53  same thing every time. You don't even have to be present while it's roasting, right? for something that is simple and the quality quality can be just as high
32:00  or higher um or at least more consistent when it comes to sample roasting. Um we
32:06  actually have gone through multiple sample roasters and tried many different ones and we're currently using the roast
32:11  our OET has so many sensors it has crack detection. It'll drop the coffee for you
32:17  um after a certain amount of development. It's very very cool. Um but yeah, overall quality um can be just as
32:24  good. Absolutely. And sometimes better. Okay, we are like half way through this
32:33  here. Um, I'm trying to think, do we want
32:40  to go through the chemical changes that are happening in coffee? We've been very concerned with the physical so far,
32:46  right? Heat, um, you know, coffee characteristics, how they kind of work
32:52  together. Again, my best kind of way to think about it is like cooking apply
32:57  coffee seeds to just like, you know, cooking a vegetable or a piece of meat
33:03  or something and like how would you adjust have to adjust the way you cook based on the size or the density um of
33:12  of those different things, right? Or baking um something like that.
33:17  There's years of practice, right? like with any discipline um to learn how
33:23  different coffee interacts with heat, right? But the big point is every single
33:29  temperature over x amount of time has an influence on the final outcome. So
33:34  controlling for that, manipulating that, um testing that over and over is is
33:39  where you learn, right? Cause and effect. So now we kind of looked at physical aspects and how they interact
33:45  with the roster and what we might change. Let's look at these chemical reactions. What are happening to our
33:51  acids, salts, sugars, bitters, our um precursors, the textural components, and the structural components of the seed?
33:58  Right? We talked about these yesterday um to kind of set the groundwork for green coffee. Um so, this is the stuff
34:04  that's going into a roaster. This is the stuff that's going to change or maybe not change um or break down or increase
34:11  when heat is applied, right? So, let's look at those changes here. Um chemical changes first acids
34:20  um organic acids some will survive um they might decrease but they will
34:25  survive citric malic and phosphoric acid right um pretty simple acids some will
34:31  transform so chlorogenic acids will break down um they might form some bitter compounds but quinic acid is
34:39  something that is formed out of out of chlorogenic acids and then newly formed acids u mostly from protein and sugar
34:46  breakdown. Acetic, formic, lactic, and glycolic acid will form during sugar
34:52  breakdown. So, this is kind of where we get that final profile um of our acids
34:59  for the coffee in roasting, right? Some will be and this is true of all these
35:04  categories. Some things will survive the roast, something will transform in the roast, or new things will be formed in
35:12  the roast that fit into these four categories. Your salts, your minerals, potassium,
35:18  magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, those will largely be unchanged in their roast. They might decrease a little bit.
35:24  Um, they don't make up very very much of the green coffee. Um and you can see
35:31  that their concentration actually increases by the time it reaches roasted coffee.
35:36  Sugars sugars that survive residual sucrose. This is true in lighter roasts. So if
35:43  you remember sucrose is the combination of glucose and fructose chains, right?
35:49  um during heating that sucrose will break or split apart into individual
35:55  glucose and fructose chains um from that sucrose breakdown. Right? So lighter roasts you tend to keep sucrossse which
36:02  is kind of medium sweet sugars. Um glucose is super sweet, fructose is the
36:07  least the least sweet, right? So the longer and longer you roast, you break down more and more of these chains and
36:14  eventually you'll burn those sugars off. So caramelization usually stir starts
36:20  around um like for sucrose caramelization starts at 367°
36:27  F or 186. Um and then it decomposes into
36:32  sucrossse and fructose. Um and those have a melting point of 370°.
36:38  Um and so in coffee caramelization usually occurs at or just before first
36:46  crack. Um, and if you go too long, they break down into carbon dioxide and water vapor. That's why CO2 is being developed
36:52  in the roast. A lot of these things will break down into CO2 components um when we cook them. So, you've got sugars to a
37:02  point and then you'll get newly formed uh caramelization um compounds. A huge
37:07  mix of them. The biggest one you may have heard of is um hydroxymethyl fuerol. This is in many things that
37:14  contain sugar and you cook them. this is developed um and it kind of gives you more of a roasty nutty flavor like brown
37:21  butter or honey. If you heat honey up, you start to get that roastier um
37:26  caramelized flavor. Bitter compounds um during the roasting
37:33  of coffee um chlorogenic acid um will
37:38  break down into lacones or or quinides. Um basically they lose a water molecule.
37:45  Um and then these lacones um uh are
37:51  basically they're esters that taste um or smell super bitter. Um so these are a
37:56  big bitter contributor. Caffeine survives the roast. It's super bitter. Um
38:02  uh there's more products from the breakdown of uh trigonelline um that are
38:07  super bitter. And then melanoidins um they're super high molecular weight
38:12  compounds. Um, again, it's part of what makes coffee change its color from green
38:18  to yellow to brown. Um, in the final product, they have some texture to them,
38:23  so they add some body. Um, but they're also pretty pretty bitter. So, you'll
38:28  find melanoidins, this color change. Um it happens in baked goods, cooked meat,
38:35  beer, um wine, processed tomatoes like melanoidins form in the cooking of a lot
38:41  of different things and it kind of gives it a cooked a cooked flavor.
38:47  Okay, so these are our our new things and if we remember acids, salts, sugars,
38:55  bitter, this will be important in brewing. So now let's go over the other half. The the things that are
39:00  hydrophobic, right? Um or things that aren't dissolved. All these things dissolve in water. These do not. So
39:07  let's turn it around and look how these change. Structural compounds. Um
39:13  these things will decrease um because you're cooking. So some of them will break down, but for the most part they
39:18  survive, right? Like the cellulose um the actual structure of the seed survives. If it didn't, we wouldn't have
39:24  roasted coffee. Um textural compounds, lipids, oils and then uh proteins and
39:31  amino acids. Um uh coffee oils and lipids may be modified in the roasting. Some um
39:39  durpines like cafe stall and kwall. These are oils. Um they survive in the
39:45  roasting. These are what we see come to the outside surface when you roast coffee for a long time. Uh newly formed
39:51  textural things, the large melanoidans that we talked about. um proteins that
39:56  are modified and fiber remnants, right? A lot of this stuff um unless you cook
40:02  to a super high temperature won't burn off, right? You think of even just putting oil in a pan, it's fine. But at
40:09  a certain point, you know your pan is hot if your oil is smoking, right?
40:15  Volatile aromatics. There are a thousand plus um volatile aromatics that are
40:22  developed or existing in roasted coffee, right? The aroma of coffee is a mixture
40:28  of a thousand compounds plus um and these are kind of the classes of them that I have listed here. So furins,
40:34  pyazines, ketones, purols, phenols, hydrocarbons, acids, and hydrides, aldahhides, esters, alcohols, sulfur
40:42  compounds, right? There's like thousands of these. Um and this is what gives coffee such a complex flavor profile,
40:50  right? Um sometimes we often group them into esters that form. Um but that uh
40:57  trigonelline which is basically you know a natural bug repellent that is found in
41:02  coffee seeds they break it breaks down into a lot of stuff some bitter um and they break down into volty aromatics.
41:10  Furins form from sugar. Pyazines come from amino acids and then you get
41:15  aldahhides, ketones, esters, phenolic compounds um forming as well. So
41:22  aldahhides um generally add fruiness, right? Um
41:28  furins uh they're more caramelly or earthy. Um
41:33  I could list, you know, a bunch of these. Um uh Damascanone
41:39  um has an apple. Um there's pineappley ones, there's banana ones, um sulfury
41:46  ones, you know, buttery, grassy, like so many of these can be contributed to
41:53  different flavor types, right? And again, these are mostly developed or mostly formed in first crack and
42:00  development. So that's why that area like 95% of the
42:06  flavor in coffee comes from first crack and development. So,
42:11  there's our coffee compounds. This is what we're dealing with when we're brewing coffee, which is now what we're
42:17  going to get into. Cool. So, these are the compounds that create our flavor
42:23  experience. Structural stuff does not get in the cup. This makes up, as we talked about
42:29  yesterday, taste, right? Sweet, sour, salty, bitter. This makes up in
42:34  combination with tastes flavor, right? something tastes like something. We
42:40  experience a mixture of aromatic compounds that reminds us of a mixture of aromatic compounds we've had in the
42:46  past. Um, and then textural, that's kind of how how we break it all
42:51  down. So, how are these compounds actually removed from coffee? It's in a process called extraction, right?
42:58  Extraction is the removal of soluble and insoluble material from coffee grounds.
43:05  So first we have to expose coffee. We have to grind it right the outside of
43:11  coffee. Um it is not very porous. Once we open coffee up and we open its
43:17  cellular structure up then we get into the porous areas of coffee and water can actually leech um into the surface of
43:24  coffee, dissolve those things or not and remove those things. Right? So soluble
43:30  and insoluble mass that's how I break down. That's why I have these halves how
43:35  I have them, right? All of these things are soluble by water. For the most part, they are um compounds whose molecu
43:43  molecular structure can bond to water. Some are more soluble than others,
43:48  meaning some dissolve really fast and some take a longer amount of time to dissolve. Right? If coffee was super
43:56  easy to brew, we'd grind it into powder and we'd get everything out of it. Right? If it was really easy to brew
44:02  coffee, if coffee didn't have complexity to it, you know, different things, we'd
44:07  just make a powder and we'd boil it. We'd get everything possible out. But we know that at a certain point, coffee
44:13  tastes bad if we brew it for too long. Um, so we're going to talk about that kind of like balancing act. Where is the
44:20  desirable extraction of these things? Insoluble things, um, you know, oils and
44:27  then the aromatics. like the aromatics we're going to remove. Aromatics are constantly being released. Textural
44:33  things, it more comes down to a different set of variables because they're not soluble. So, how do we get those out of coffee? And structural,
44:40  that's the stuff we leave behind in the filter, right? So, we'll talk about
44:45  soluble and insoluble things, but to break down, you know, what that makes up in the final cup. Well, this is the
44:52  composition of the final cup. We have soluble compounds making taste, aromatics making the aroma, insoluble
44:59  compounds making the texture, right? Taste, aroma, texture equals flavor. Like we talked about yesterday, um,
45:08  cool. So, let's get into it a little bit here. How do we remove insoluble compounds in
45:15  um, extraction? Well, these things are not soluble, right? So the way we get them out of the
45:21  particles, right, the way water removes um this stuff is pressure, right? You
45:27  think of an aerop press. When you apply pressure, it's going to force those oils
45:33  and proteins out of the particles. Higher temperature means the molecules
45:38  of water is moving faster and it tends to knock those things out better. Um agitation, right, physically stirring
45:45  that stuff will remove those oils. um longer contact time um will remove those
45:52  oils. But then the big thing is just how porous the filter is determines how much of that stuff actually makes it into the
45:58  cup, right? All of that stuff is present in the brew. But if you have a super
46:03  non-porous paper filter, a lot of those oils are just going to get stuck in the filter, right? versus mesh, wire, um
46:12  different filters of that type, um metal filters, uh a lot of that stuff will be
46:17  allowed through, right? That's why French presses are super heavy versus a pourover being a lot more delicate,
46:24  right? So, brew methods, we might have heard of like the body to clarity scale,
46:30  and you can put brew methods on that scale, line them up, either being super heavy body or not heavy in their body.
46:37  Um, they're kind of like different perspectives on the coffee. More oil covers up your pallet. Um, so you sense
46:45  less of the taste things, right? The things we taste, sweet, sour, salty,
46:50  bitter, we taste those on our tongue receptors. If you have a lot of oil covering your tongue, you taste less of
46:56  those things. It's less intense, right? So that's why it's called body to clarity scale.
47:03  All right? Volatile aromatics equal aroma. Um, volatile aromatics after they're formed
47:10  in the roast, they're constantly being released, right? They don't need water to be released. So, when your coffee is
47:16  in storage and CO2 is being released, aromatics are being released, too, right? You squeeze a bag of coffee, you
47:23  smell it. Those are volatile aromatics. Um, there's a huge degassing during
47:28  grinding, a huge release of aromatics, right? When you're actually breaking that coffee up and you have a lot of
47:33  friction, hot water will unlock aromatics, right? That initial pour of water, the bloom releases a ton of
47:41  aroma. And then there's a constant release in the final brew cup, right? And it smells
47:48  different when it's hot from when it's cool. So temperature changes will even
47:53  unlock different kinds of aromomas, right? So aromatics are constantly releasing. Um the roast kind of sets the
48:01  bar for how many aromatics are present. Um but that's why you let a bag of coffee sit for a year before you drink
48:07  it. It doesn't taste great. There's like no aromatics to it. You're just getting whatever remaining um solubles are
48:15  there. Um but you have zero aroma, right? So solubles, acids, salts, sugars,
48:23  bitters. This equals taste. Everybody kind of experiences taste the same way. You may have heard of super tasters.
48:29  They literally have more palp on our tongue than the normal the normal person. Um but sweet, sour, salty,
48:36  bitter we all experience, right? Um we can actually measure the extraction of
48:43  soluble compounds. We cannot measure really insoluble or volatile aromatic
48:50  compounds um necessarily. Um we can measure the concentration of these in
48:55  the final cup. Um these create sweet, sour, salty, bitter. Um roasted coffee
49:02  around 28 to 30% of roasted coffee is
49:08  soluble compounds, right? By weight. So we're starting out with 28% of roasted
49:16  coffee. And like we've mentioned, these things um are extracted at different
49:22  rates. So let's kind of look at this here. Here's our scale of 0% extraction
49:27  to 28% extraction. Right? Again, if you ground coffee into powder and you boiled
49:34  it and got all 28% out, and we mentioned that, you know, all of these things
49:40  occur in different increments uh within the coffee. We've also
49:45  discussed that different compounds have different solubility, right? based on how they bond to actual actual water
49:53  molecules, right? They're hydrogen bonding. Acids and salts are super
49:59  simple compounds, meaning they, you know, they're not crazy complex change and they lock with water or water bonds
50:06  to them very very easily. Caffeine is also part of this. So, caffeine is
50:12  bitter in flavor, but caffeine extracts like immediately. So acids and salts,
50:18  they are highly soluble compounds. They extract like within the first third of the brew time, if not the first fourth,
50:25  right? By percentage, they don't make up very much. Sugars
50:30  take longer to break down. There are simple sugars, um, and then there's your
50:36  more complex sugars, right? So sucrose and fructose, more simple. gluc um
50:42  glucose meaning you're more complex if I have that right. I don't even know what I said. But it takes time to break down
50:49  different kinds of sugars. The majority of your brew is spent getting things
50:54  that are sweet out of the cup. So simple to complex compounds that extract throughout the brew. Some of them you'll
51:01  get in the middle or the beginning, most of the middle and then you'll still be getting some sugars as you trail off to
51:07  the end of the cup or the end of the brew, right? And then bitter compounds tend to be
51:14  heavier molecular structure things. They are complex compounds that take longer to dissolve. Um, and that's why if you
51:23  brew your coffee forever, it gets super super super bitter. You start unlocking more and more and more and more bitter
51:29  roasted supercooked compounds. Right, cool. So, acids and salts first, then
51:36  sugars, then bitter compounds. Like I said, if we pull everything out of
51:42  coffee possible, if we extract all 28%, it tastes really, really bad. So, what
51:48  that tells us is that somewhere within this extraction is the most ideal point to stop the brew
51:57  and you'll get a balance between acidity, saltiness, sweetness, and bitterness.
52:03  Right? Like a well-cooked dish, you want a little bit of everything. But where is
52:08  that balance point? Right? Too much salt or too much acidity or too much sugar can ruin a dish. So where is that?
52:16  Well, that point is right where you've extracted all possible sugar, right? This is the sweet spot. So we know the
52:24  term under extraction, right? Is basically if you extract no bitterness,
52:30  you are under extracting your coffee because you only have acid, salt, and sugar. That combination makes a super
52:38  savory um you know like not crazy sweet
52:44  um because you don't have balancing bitterness right it's like very savory salty um sour cups I should replace the
52:52  first word with sour sour salty and savory is what you get when you just have acid salt and sugar this is
52:58  underneath 18% extraction 17 16 15 the more salty and savory you get because
53:04  your acids and salt Salts make up most of the cup. There's really no aftertaste here. Sugars, right? If you extract all
53:12  potential sugar, you maximize sweetness. You get a little bit of balancing bitterness in there. That's where you
53:18  get the bright sweet long lasting cups of coffee, right? Over extraction is
53:24  when you go beyond where there are any sugars remaining. So over 23 and a half%
53:30  extraction, the cup really starts to empty out. Um, the acidity goes from
53:36  being like bright or sour to now just sharp. Um, and then you have this aftertaste that's super papery, right?
53:43  Super dry. Um, I always think of like, you know, when you have ibuprofen in
53:49  your mouth and it dissolves, that chalky feeling, that's bitterness. That is over
53:54  extraction, right? So, a great way to test this if you have a pour over, um,
54:00  you can just follow your normal brewing cycle except add a whole another pour to
54:05  the end of it and just switch out the cup maybe every 45 seconds or minute um,
54:11  from underneath the pour over and taste the beginning, the middle, the end, and you'll see where the extraction of sugar
54:18  stops, where there's no more sugar and it's only bitterness left. Um, and you can kind of see where that ideal
54:24  extraction point is, right? So, we're going to kind of keep going through this and let's relate it to flavor now. So,
54:31  high solubility things, acids and salts equal sour, salty, savory. Well, if you
54:37  were to map out your flavor experience over time, the things that are extracted
54:44  first are what we taste first. This to me is like the most fascinating thing about coffee brewing. Um, things that
54:51  are sour are super intense right out in the front and then they drop off really
54:57  quick, right? So again, quick aftertaste. So think of like a lime,
55:02  right? If you bite into a lime, it punches you right in the face really fast, but that experience
55:10  decelerates really fast, right? It goes from super intense to like it's not even an experience anymore.
55:17  Um, sugars, something that is crazy sweet takes a long time to build and
55:23  then it peaks right before you swallow the product and then you have a long
55:29  pleasant aftertaste, right? So, I think of like milk chocolate, right? You chew
55:34  and chew and chew, it gets sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. You reach full sweetness when it's fully broken up and
55:40  then it takes a long time um to go away. you feel like you'll taste that candy bar forever, right?
55:47  Over extraction. Um, the emphasis is in the aftertaste, right? So, the emphasis
55:52  moves from beginning to middle to now the end. It's super bland up front and
55:57  then it gets really dry and nasty in the aftertaste, right? Cherry cough syrup,
56:03  the worst part is what you're left with in the aftertaste. It's cloying. It's medicinal. It feels like it's going to
56:09  last forever, right? So, if you under extract coffee, it's sour and fast. If
56:15  you over extract coffee, get super dry in the aftertaste and boring up front.
56:21  Well extracted coffee, let's look at what is this right here.
56:28  Well extracted coffee um has that pop of acidity, right? That complex, sometimes
56:34  mouthwatering pop. Then you reach full sweetness right before a long balanced
56:41  aftertaste. Right? So that's the spot around 21% extraction. Some coffees may
56:46  be less, some coffees may be more. It all depends. But this is kind of the arc of flavor experience that we all really
56:53  enjoy. Right. Cool. We're almost done here. We've got
57:00  not too many slides left. So let's talk about we've gone over kind of materials of roasting. Let's talk about our
57:05  materials of brewing and how we actually use our brew materials to achieve that perfect flavor curve. Right? Roasting is
57:13  all about creating the potential flavor curve. All the ingredients are there. Brewing is about unlocking those
57:20  ingredients to the perfect point, right? And that's the art of brewing. So, brewing necessities. We need coffee. We
57:28  need water. We need a grinder. We need a a way to measure things, right? like
57:34  time and weight. We need a scale. We need our apparatus. That could be a coffee pot. It could be a pourover
57:40  setup, a French press, whatever. If it's not cold brew, we need to make hot water. So, like kind of our equipment.
57:47  And then a filter, right? A way to hold the grounds back and allow the solubles through.
57:52  So, all of these things then apply to what
57:58  we have to know. This is the stuff we have to have. This is the stuff we need
58:03  to know about. We need to know how much coffee to use. We need to know how much
58:09  water to use, right? Huge part of our recipe. We need to know the right grind
58:15  size. And we need to know how long we are supposed to brew that coffee. Right?
58:20  These two are linked as well. So these two are inextricably linked. These two are also inextricably linked. We need to
58:27  know the correct water temperature and we need to have a technique. We need
58:32  to just simply know how to use the apparatus, right? Um the water temperature for hot coffee
58:40  um you can change it and it will subtly change the extraction rate, right? Lower
58:45  temp will extract slower, higher temp will extract faster. Um but it's a
58:50  smaller variable than these ones up here. Brew technique is deeply important too, right? Knowing how to pour, when to
58:57  pour um your water if you're doing a pour over, knowing um simply how to use your equipment is really really
59:04  important. But we're going to spend more of our time on these four, right? Amount of coffee and amount of water, grind
59:09  size, and brew time. And let's relate it to everything we just talked about with sweet, sour, salty, bitter, right? So
59:16  our amount of coffee and water, it's kind of like baking, right? knowing how much flour, sugar, salt, water, like how
59:23  much of an ingredient to put in, right? If your ratio of ingredients is off, the
59:29  final product is not going to be good. Same thing here, right? Knowing how much coffee to use with how much water
59:36  most impacts the concentration of the final cup, right? How much stuff is in
59:42  the final cup? You have to extract it to get it there. But using a ton of coffee
59:48  versus not enough coffee has the most drastic impact on concentration, right?
59:53  The average kind of ratio is one part coffee, 16 parts water. Um, this is
1:00:01  going to be different depending on the coffee, depending on your pallet. Different um, places prefer different
1:00:07  ratios. I've had grape cups that are brewed 1 to 20, right? A lot more watery. I've had grape cups that are
1:00:13  brewed at 1 to 12. super super strong. But a good ratio with a good extraction
1:00:21  lands you around a 1.35% concentration. Again, concentration
1:00:27  being how much stuff is in the final cup. Around 1.3%.
1:00:32  Very little, right? What that tells us is that acid, salt, sugars, and bitters,
1:00:38  um, they're extremely important. They are extremely powerful. A little bit
1:00:43  goes a long way. Right? So minor adjustments to any of these variables means a major adjustment to this number
1:00:50  um which gets you a totally different flavor profile. Right? We can measure this with something called a refratoter.
1:00:57  This one VST refratoter is pretty expensive but it shines light through the coffee um and it can measure how
1:01:04  many um solids are in that liquid um are
1:01:09  in that liquid as a percent right concentration percent. So again, if you adjust
1:01:16  your ratio of coffee to water, you are going to heavily change um the
1:01:21  concentration. So a balanced ratio, I say 1 to4 to 18, somewhere in there,
1:01:27  you're going to find a balanced ratio. U most often it gets you 1.2 to 1.5 TDS or
1:01:34  concentration. You tend to get a balance between flavor and texture. The way I think about concentration or ratio is
1:01:41  how much coffee do I taste in this water? If I taste the coffee and water
1:01:47  equally or in a harmonious way, I probably have a good ratio. If I don't
1:01:54  use enough water or if I have way too much coffee in my brewer, I tend to get
1:01:59  super heavy, super savory brews, right? Like so heavy um you can't taste any
1:02:06  water, right? I can only taste coffee. You're probably too strong. Maybe you need to use less coffee.
1:02:12  Um, and then if your coffee is super weak, watered down, you taste a ton of
1:02:18  water and not very much coffee, maybe you need to add more coffee to your brew, right? So
1:02:25  again, it's just kind of a matter of like overwhelming amount of coffee versus an underwhelming
1:02:31  amount of coffee versus a good ratio. We'll kind of hitch that balance between
1:02:36  coffee and water and make a nice flavor experience.
1:02:42  So we go back, that's amount of coffee and water check. Now we need to figure
1:02:48  out the correct grind size and the correct amount of time to brew. This is
1:02:53  where we round back to extraction, right? Um, we talk about that 0 to 28
1:02:58  scale. Well, the brew time and the grind size work together to determine how much
1:03:05  extraction you're getting. Basically, we want to grind coffee to the right size
1:03:11  and brew for the right amount of time to get us a full saturation.
1:03:18  enough time to dissolve all the stuff we want and then remove all of that stuff
1:03:23  down into the cup without getting too much or too little. Right? It's a balancing act of finding the right size
1:03:30  for the right amount of time of brewing. Right? So, it's a three-step process. Saturate, dissolve, and remove.
1:03:37  Um, on a grinder, bigger number means coarse. A smaller number means fine.
1:03:44  Coarse means bigger particles. Fine means smaller particles. Right? So if
1:03:51  you think about having one coffee bean and you divide that one coffee bean into
1:03:56  big stuff, you're not exposing very much of that coffee. Low surface area, right?
1:04:02  Um there's a lot of stuff hidden inside of that particle. Because there's more
1:04:09  stuff inside of there, you need a longer brew time, right? So coarser the grind
1:04:15  needs a longer amount of time to brew. So you can actually get in, dissolve and remove. A super fine grind, right,
1:04:23  you've exposed a lot of the coffee, you don't need to brew very long. It's pretty easy to get in there and extract
1:04:28  and remove that stuff, right? When it comes to brew methods where the coffee
1:04:33  just sits, you can control the time easily, right? But when it comes to brew
1:04:39  methods where the water travels through the grounds, they kind of work against each other. Larger particles need more
1:04:46  time, but the water flows through super easily, right? Smaller particles, you
1:04:52  don't need as much time to fully brew those, but it works against you because that water moves super super slow
1:04:59  through that sandlike texture, right? It resists the water moving versus these
1:05:05  rocks let the water move, right? sand versus rocks. So the coarser and coarser
1:05:10  and coarser you go, the exponentially less less less you're
1:05:16  going to extract. The finer and finer and finer you go, you tend to extract more and more and more and more. Right?
1:05:23  So when we relate this back to flavor, this is kind of my rules of thirds. A
1:05:28  coarse grind tends to get you under extracted sour cups. too fine of a grind, you get super
1:05:36  bitter cups. The perfect grind size results in the perfect brew time,
1:05:42  results in the perfect flavor experience, right? Where the emphasis of your flavor is right here before the
1:05:49  aftertaste. This is our brewing control chart. So,
1:05:56  um, you know, I wish they had like a roasting control chart to help me explain like too fast of a roast, too
1:06:04  long of a roast, right? Too hot of a roast, too cool of a roast. I need to find a roaster who wants to make that
1:06:09  chart with me. Um, but yeah, you can see that there's the extraction, right?
1:06:15  Think of that as grind size and brew time, concentration, amount of coffee, and amount of water. And then these
1:06:23  lines are your ratio. So like I believe this is 1:16 ratio.
1:06:28  This is like 1 to 8 um 14 1 and so on and so forth. So you want to
1:06:35  find a ratio um and a grind size and brew time that
1:06:40  basically hits the right kind of concentration. I could spend a long time talking about how that works, but I love
1:06:46  this little chart. Here's another chart, the one I made based on flavor, right?
1:06:51  Um, oh that's awesome, Isaac. I need to talk to them then because I I want to hear
1:06:57  like a I want to see a roasting chart that helps you troubleshoot which direction you should go, right? One
1:07:03  variable at a time. Roast it, taste it. How do we then profile a profiling
1:07:08  chart? I think that'd be so sweet. I've never seen one before. Um
1:07:14  because yeah, there's only x amount of variables that you should really be manipulating, right? If a cup is super
1:07:19  thick and savory, use less coffee. If a cuppper is super boring and watery, use
1:07:25  more coffee. If a cup is super sour, grind finer and brew longer. If a cup is
1:07:32  super bitter, use uh or grind coarser, right? And
1:07:39  eventually you're going to find that right spot, one variable at a time. Boom, boom, boom. Whoa, that was weird.
1:07:45  Did you see that? how the line turned into a picture. I have transform um settings on like
1:07:52  between every slide, but I don't know how that's happening. That's very crazy. All right. Anyway, um I'm going to reach
1:07:59  out to Mil City. Thanks, Isaac. I want to I want to see if they have that. So, what's in your coffee? Aromatics,
1:08:06  volatile compounds, soluble compounds. That sums up this class, right? We have
1:08:16  these in the seeds. Um when we import the coffee, everything that has preceded
1:08:22  importing has changed um what these are and then what increments they appear in.
1:08:29  Roasting caramelizes and unlocks them, right? And then grinding and adding
1:08:35  water exposes them and pulls them out. Then we have them in the final cup,
1:08:40  right? This is the end of our series. That's what's in coffee. What is coffee?
1:08:47  This is the very first question um I ask in part one of this entire series. What
1:08:55  is coffee? Right? We've been going through every single step, not every
1:09:00  single one, but all the big ones, right? And trying to look at some of the detail and some of the nuance of them.
1:09:08  Um, and you know, if you've taken all of these, hopefully you've learned something new and maybe your definition
1:09:14  of what coffee is has expanded. But as a quick review, we've examined coffee as a
1:09:20  plant, right? Coffee is a plant first and foremost. This is really where it all starts. This is where all of those
1:09:26  flavor compounds first exist and are developed um through this intricate
1:09:31  system of growing, utilizing nutrients, producing fruit, right? That sets our
1:09:37  baseline. Coffee is a plant. Coffee is there's another crazy transformation. Coffee is agriculture.
1:09:44  It is farming, right? It is people on the farm level making um decision after
1:09:50  decision after decision. And all of that, you know, deeply affects the
1:09:55  coffee. Coffee is a process, right? We talked about processing washed honey natural
1:10:02  and then adding fermentation as a variable to it. This has a massive
1:10:08  impact on the coffee, on the amount of time it takes to produce a coffee, on
1:10:13  the yield of how much coffee you're getting and the final product. It's an industry. We talked about
1:10:19  milling. Um we talked about selling coffee, buying coffee, um cupping coffee
1:10:26  for buying, loading coffee and getting it shipped. all those logistics and those challenges. Um especially in you
1:10:33  know the world as it is today in the economy as it is today. The this whole side of coffee is um a massive
1:10:41  determining factor in why a producer does what they do why a roasting business does what they do. Uh we talked
1:10:48  about coffee as a science cupping sample roasting evaluating green
1:10:53  grading. Um there's teams of people devoted to that. And then man, these
1:10:58  transformations are wild. Coffee is an art. That's what we went through today, right? Um brewing coffee. Um and when I
1:11:05  talk about, you know, coffee as an art form and I think about the end of the supply chain, um you know, a huge goal
1:11:15  of this is not just to think about the technical steps, but to recognize the amount of people within every step.
1:11:21  Right? There are people um and countless numbers of people involved um to make
1:11:27  coffee happen. One of my favorite words I've heard about coffee recently is that coffee is emergent, right? It is the sum
1:11:34  of all of the millions of parts creating something that is completely new and unique, right? Um something emerges from
1:11:42  all of this work. You know, an experience we've never ever ever ever had before. Um coffee is service, right?
1:11:49  we are in service to one another in the industry and then ultimately at the end we are serving somebody this cup or
1:11:56  we're making it for ourselves and in that way somebody has served us along the entire way. Um and coffee is people
1:12:03  right it's ultimately people makes coffee happen. Um, the plant was
1:12:08  used, um, it was found, it was shared, it was propagated throughout the world,
1:12:14  but it was all people that made that happen. And now it's been turned into a massive industry. And now we have
1:12:19  specialty coffee because people desire to learn more stuff and they desire to
1:12:24  make it an art form, right? As we've talked about. So specialty coffee is is
1:12:29  all of these things. And it's important to step back and appreciate what all goes into coffee and understand why it's
1:12:35  even important to us as humans, right? Because it is an art form and art is important to us. Learning is important.
1:12:41  Um and growing in new experiences and connection is important to us. Here's the references for today. I'm going to
1:12:48  get these uploaded so you can look at all of them. Um lots of good stuff in here to read
1:12:54  through if you want to like really dig into the nerd um and science stuff behind it.
1:13:00  That's coffee is an art. That's part six. That is the coffee is series. And
1:13:05  again, if you're interested in taking all of these and you haven't, we go through all of those steps. Those are
1:13:11  all the classes we have. Coffee is a plant, agriculture, an industry, um a
1:13:17  process, a science, and an art. I really appreciate y'all joining.
