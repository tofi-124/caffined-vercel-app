0:00  Welcome to Ednu. We're finishing up the coffee is series this week, part five and part six. Um we've gone parts one
0:07  through four up to now. Today, coffee is a science. Um this one's called a
0:14  science. The next one is called coffee is an art. You know, we've all kind of discussed the the science and art of
0:19  coffee and that being part of the draw toward coffee. So, we're kind of breaking it up. I think every every step
0:25  involves science and art, right? It's not exclusive to any single part. But um
0:31  in today's class, we're going to look at more of the technical side of kind of the end of the supply chain. And then uh
0:37  tomorrow we'll look at more of the the artistic side of the of the end of the supply chain. So what is science? Let's
0:42  kind of define what a science is. I love etmology. I love words um and kind of getting to their root meaning. Um today
0:50  science is defined as kind of any system of knowledge um concerned with the universe and its phenomena, right? just
0:56  any system of knowledge about a thing. Um, and in specialty coffee, we are
1:01  constantly trying to learn, right? We are constantly trying to gain a deeper knowledge of coffee. There's always
1:07  something new to learn because specialty coffee in particular is a young industry. Um, this comes from the Latin
1:13  root scientia, which is knowledge, a knowing, expertness. Um, which is likely
1:19  related to the verb uh cindere which means to separate or distinguish. And
1:24  again I like etmology because that's exactly what we do in specialy coffee right we are distinguishing what we are
1:31  experiencing distinguishing different coffees from one another in order to gain a deeper knowing or expertness
1:38  about that thing right so um today that's kind of what we're looking at
1:43  what goes into the distinguishing of different coffees from one another or the analysis and the knowledge gaining
1:49  of coffees from one another right welcome everybody else who's just kind of jumped in Atypical Farm in Puerto
1:55  Rico. Wonderful. And uh Lee from Germany, welcome in. So
2:03  again, we're kind of like always trying to discover what makes coffee taste the way it does. Coffee can display itself
2:10  in an infinite amount of ways. No two cups are ever the same, right? Um and
2:16  that's what makes coffee so fascinating to us. We never have the same experience twice. It can mimic all sorts of flavors
2:24  and it's because of everything, right? The more and more we investigate, the more we realize we don't know. And so,
2:30  um, in part one, we just talked about the plant itself, right? Um, in part one of this series, just the genetic
2:38  expression of that cultivar and the place it's growing changes how it's going to taste. And then there's the
2:43  human intervention part of farming, right? um how that soil is is treated um
2:50  how you know the landscape is maintained um different farming systems, different
2:56  choices uh made within those farming systems, harvest timing, all that sort of stuff
3:02  on the farming end, right? That's classes one and two. In class three, we look at processing and milling, right?
3:08  So how long between harvest and processing? The processing method and equipment used. Um how long the fruit is
3:14  on the seed, right? Microbes that are present and the fermentation that happens throughout the processing,
3:21  drying time, you know, resting before milling, what kind of milling equipment is used,
3:27  the timing of all of these things, right? We looked at all these different variables. And these lists, you know,
3:34  could be so much bigger than I have written out here, right? But parts one through three is is all about what
3:40  heavily influences the cup on kind of that farm and processing and milling level. Then when it comes to exporting
3:46  and importing, we're talking about kind of like the environment, the packaging,
3:51  storage, um, and all of that can have an influence on how that coffee tastes, right? So now today we talk about having
3:58  green coffee at hand. Um, we are talking about roasting, we're talking about
4:03  brewing, and we're talking about our perception of the compounds within coffee. And that's kind of what we're
4:09  going to frame these next two classes around. We're going to be looking at the green coffee compounds, how those
4:14  transform in the roast, and then how we perceive those um when we go to taste
4:20  coffee, right? Um, so there's an infinite number of variables at play, and that does not change. So we will
4:27  examine green coffee compounds and physical attributes. How those interact in the roster, what those compounds turn
4:33  into, how those interact with the taster, and then how all those things interact with the brewer. Right? That's
4:39  the next two classes. So today's objectives, we're going to look at physical characteristics of green coffee, how coffee is green graded,
4:47  right? That first analysis. We'll look at the compounds present in green coffee, how we perceive those
4:53  compounds, how humans perceive flavor and what flavor is, and then how coffee
4:59  is evaluated in cupping up to this point in history. Cool. All right, let's go
5:06  ahead and get into it. We might take a break um here in a here in a little bit, but again, interrupt me. Let me know if
5:12  you have questions um at any point. Happy to answer them. Thank you for being here. Let's go for it. So, what is
5:18  Green Coffee? That's where we're starting at today. We are an importer. We work with Green Coffee. Um, we just
5:25  gave a big warehouse tour actually over the weekend. You know, we've got um tens of thousands of bags sitting in our
5:31  warehouse. Um, and within those bags, we have individual seeds, right? Those seeds are processed, right? The fruit
5:38  has been removed. Those seeds are dried. Um, the moisture content, as we talked about in the previous class, is 12% or
5:45  lower. Um they have been had the parchment removed in milling. They were
5:50  bagged. We imported them and now they are unroasted um in their juke bags. Um
5:57  and yeah, raw coffee seeds, right? That is green coffee. How is green coffee
6:02  evaluated? Well, we've got two systems for evaluation. Green grading, which is
6:08  more visual evaluation, and then cupping. Um, green grading isn't I feel
6:14  like green grading is maybe practiced less and less and less and less over time. Um, we don't green grade every
6:21  single lot of coffee we get in, but green grading is really important um,
6:26  particularly at the origin level when it comes to preparing um, to sell a lot of
6:31  coffee. So, we're going to go through the steps of green grading, right? physical evaluation
6:36  um and talk about what is important here. But at the same time, the physical
6:42  attributes of green grading apply to roasting, right? When we go to roast coffee, the physical structure of the
6:49  seed is deeply important, right? Um and so, um going through this green grading,
6:54  looking at these physical aspects helps us kind of like set the table for the roasting conversation we'll have in the
7:00  next course. So green grading is a system for evaluating and classifying green coffee um based on physical
7:06  attributes and then natural defects that come about right coffee is an agricultural product there are going to
7:13  be flaws there is never going to be the most perfect lot in the world with zero flaws perfect seeds that are all uniform
7:20  so this is kind of our system for evaluating how many flaws are present and then the other physical attributes
7:26  of of that lot um green grading is typically done in 350 g representative
7:34  samples. So when a lot is say received um to a mill, they might pull little
7:41  bits of coffee from as many bags as possible of that entire lot, right? And
7:46  that's what we call a representative sample, trying to get, you know, not just 350 grams from one bag, one kind of
7:53  area, right? Um different parties green grade for different reasons. Um, and green grading
8:01  is kind of like done in the kind of like the order of variables we're going to go through. So things that are classified,
8:07  things that are recorded are screen size, density, moisture content, and the
8:14  defects that are present. Right? So there's kind of a system uh for
8:19  basically taking that 350 grand sample and then measuring or sorting out some
8:26  of these things um to kind of get a representation of that final lot. Right?
8:32  So um let's talk about screen size first. Screen size is a way of just
8:38  measuring the physical size of the seeds. Again, within a single bag of
8:43  coffee, you're going to have a gambit of sizes, right? Um, so screens are kind of
8:48  what you see here, right? These are little trays and they have these screens. Um, and there are circular
8:54  holes, um, measured in 164th inch increments. Um, so a screen size of 16
9:02  is 16 over 64 in diameter holes. So, um,
9:07  tons of factors will will result in different size seeds, right? Um, for example, Pakamara, a variety that grows
9:14  super huge seeds. Well, your average screen size in a lot is going to be very, very different than like, you
9:19  know, a normal typica plants seeds. Um, and so you basically put these seeds in
9:26  the top tray. You might have multiple screen sizes. They're stacked one on top of another. Shake those around. Shake
9:32  them. Shake them. Shake them. the seeds will fall through and you'll get your distribution of screen sizes that are
9:38  present right um this is not something
9:43  I'm trying to think how to say this for many countries like this chart listed
9:48  here um there are specifications so like if a mill receives a lot of coffee um
9:57  you will measure the screen size distribution and that will kind of determine what grade of coffee you are
10:04  dealing with, right? So small um like central um America and Mexico is 14,
10:11  right? 14 64th inch diameters. Sagundas second and then superior these are the
10:17  best, right? So typically kind of that like 17 to 19 range is kind of
10:22  considered normal screen size depending on the country you're in. Right? Colombia has supremo and Excels. So
10:28  those are their two grades. Africa, bigger seeds are double A to A to B to
10:33  C. And these double A and A are considered the highest quality. So when
10:39  a mill receives a lot of coffee, they might measure this screen size distribution in order to know how much
10:47  they need to sort out to achieve a supremo, for example. Or they're just
10:53  going to say like this is kind of like what the lot is, right? and can communicate that on. Um, so this might
11:00  be a precursor to sorting out certain screen sizes and in order to achieve a
11:06  certain kind of lot. Hopefully that that kind of makes sense. But yeah, countries have different specifications.
11:11  Um, and this kind of helps determine what that coffee is worth, right? When it comes to say like, you know,
11:18  commodity or you know slightly higher levels um of coffee.
11:26  Next thing is density. So density is something we might measure because density kind of tells you about the
11:32  cellular structure of the seed, right? So mass over volume is density. Um
11:39  great way to think about this is one gram of water is about 1 milll of space taken up. Right? That's why we measure,
11:46  you know, density is why we can measure pourovers on a gram scale. We know how
11:52  many milliliters of water we are pouring out, right? So things that are more dense like a rock are heavy and compact
11:58  versus cork which is kind of large open cells, right? Very hollow. It's not very
12:04  dense. Um so different coffees will have different densities again because of everything that preceded the green
12:11  grinding. Um you can measure it kind of like two ways. There's bulk density
12:16  where you're just kind of measuring green coffee in a graduated tube. Um, and you will basically divide the mass
12:25  of that green coffee by the volume it takes up. That gives you bulk density. This is technically an incorrect number.
12:32  You'll get a value that's less than one. But coffee is more dense than water. So
12:38  it means its value should be more than one if we're taking true density, which you can measure by liquid displacement.
12:44  The main thing here is that however you measure density, you do it consistently. So liquid displacement is a way to get
12:51  true density. You will basically add x amount of water um to a graduated
12:57  cylinder. Then you will add x amount of coffee and you will see by how much that
13:03  water is displaced. Um, and so yeah, measure the mass of the object, measure
13:09  the initial volume of the liquid, then measure the displaced volume of the liquid, then you'll calculate the volume
13:16  of the object by that displacement. So obviously you have to put green coffee in water to do this. Not ideal. Um, but
13:25  that's how you would get get true density. I could go through that um a little more in depth um if you want to,
13:31  but basically let's say like a rock has a mass of 520 g. You've got 1,000 mls of
13:38  water. When you put that rock into the cylinder, maybe your volume goes up to
13:43  1,220 ms. You will then basically subtract that 1220 from 1,000.
13:51  That's a 220 ml displacement. To get the density, you will then divide
13:58  the mass of the rock, 520 grams, by that 220 mil displacement, and that is 2.36.
14:07  That's your density. So, if you did it with coffee, you would get 1 something most likely. So, again, there's a
14:13  difference between those two, but um that tells you basically how compact,
14:18  how heavy that coffee is. Typically, coffee that is denser has a tighter
14:24  cellular structure and might have more flavor compounds within it. Um,
14:30  at origin before coffee is bagged up, um, a good way of sorting coffee is on a
14:36  density table. It's like a tilted vibrating table and it might have tons
14:41  of numbers number numbers of teeth and you'll get different densities kind of rising or falling to different areas and
14:47  falling off of that table and they can sort that coffee by density. Things that are super super light might be like an
14:55  aborted seed, a seed that is maybe half of a shell um or something like that,
15:00  right? Things that aren't um super dense usually have a defect. So that's a good way good way of grading coffee.
15:09  Another thing we'll measure moisture content. We've talked about moisture content already when it came to drying.
15:14  Optimal content 9 to 12% you'll see on average. What that tells you is how much
15:20  water is within that cellular structure of the seed. Right? Um some water is
15:25  very free. All right? If you have a sponge full of water and you squeeze it, a lot of free water will fall. Some of
15:31  that water is more integrated into the structure. That's what we call water activity. So measuring moisture content
15:38  kind of gives us insight into the state of the water um inside. And that's why 9
15:43  to 12% is ideal. That's like where microbial growth can't proliferate um
15:51  but quality won't degrade. 9 to 12% is the sweet spot. Not everybody has a
15:56  water activity meter. We've been tracking water activity for years in our lab um in order to learn more about
16:03  water activity. Um but moisture content is a different kind of meter um and it
16:08  can give you similar information. So um that's kind of a moisture content
16:14  meter. They look very different. I had another picture up. This is water activity. It's a much more expensive
16:19  piece of equipment. Okay. Defects. Defects. Defects.
16:25  Defects. So, um, this is like the SEA defect poster. And at this point, you
16:33  know, there's certain kind of like standards for screen size, density, and moisture content that helps a coffee
16:39  achieve a higher quality status. Um but then when we get into specialty coffee
16:45  we are talking about farming, harvesting, sorting, processing and
16:50  milling that is so quality focused that minimal defects make it into the final
16:56  lot. This looks kind of fuzzy. I thought it'd look um higher quality than this.
17:02  So I might have to check that out after the class. But let's talk about defects just a little bit. Specialty grade
17:08  coffee must have zero category 1 defects, which we'll look at on this
17:14  left panel. And they must have equal to or less than five category 2 defects,
17:21  which we'll talk about. Um, it also says zero Quakers are allowed. Quakers have
17:27  been a big topic lately. Quakers are like after you roast a coffee, you get these really light seeds. They're super
17:33  hollow. They taste maybe like woody, grassy, not very developed. Um, you
17:40  know, in most publications going all the way back to the 80s in the first cupping handbook,
17:47  Quakers have been labeled as immature or underripe seeds that make it into the roast. Um
17:54  uh but there's been some research and there's actually no correlation from the number of uh immature seeds found in
18:02  green coffee to the number found in the final roast. Um so immature seeds do
18:07  definitely produce Quakers, but there's something else that produces Quakers as well. Quakers can can just happen in the
18:13  roast. Um it says zero Quakers are allowed to be specialty coffee. There's
18:18  Quakers all the time in specialty coffee that come up in the roast. Often roasters will sort them out. So, you
18:25  know, by definition, Quakers mean a coffee is not specialty,
18:30  but that's kind of ridiculous. We drink especially all the time with Quakers. If you want to read more about this, I
18:35  highly recommend um uh Rob H, um has a nice little blog on kind of the history
18:41  of Quakers and what they might actually be and how to identify them. Um, if you just search Robus Quakers, um, I highly
18:48  recommend, uh, reading that little blog, but kind of a tangent, but we are able to say that all Quakers,
18:56  um, were immature beans, but not all immature beans become Quakers. They happen again, it's an agricultural
19:02  product. So, that's kind of our overarching, you know, definition of specialty by
19:10  um, physical attributes only, right? Not even talking about flavor yet. Um, so
19:16  again, 350 gram is our sample weight. We usually roast 100 grams. Um, here's
19:23  moisture standard, right? 10 to 12%. Um, uh, here's moisture activity
19:29  standards. Uh, bean size. Um, no more than 5% variance
19:35  from purchase contracted specs. Um, so there's more methods of classification
19:42  for for specialty coffee based on all the things we've discussed so far.
19:48  Um, now this is where you get into category one and category 2. Category one are
19:55  full blacks, full sours, dried cherry pods that make it through fungus,
20:00  foreign matter, severe insect damage. This is the number of seeds present in a
20:06  350 gram sample. Um, that would equal an equivalent defect, right? So, it takes
20:12  five insect damage seeds to equal one category one defect, if that kind of
20:18  makes sense here. And again, by sea standard, one of these occurring in a
20:23  350 g sample means it's not specialty coffee. Um, but that's why we green
20:28  grade. If you have a 350 gram sample and you see multiple full blacks, that's an indication that there are many of those
20:34  in the lot and that's not going to taste great when you roast it, right? Um, here's category 2 defects. You can see
20:41  it requires more of these seeds to equal one present defect, partial black,
20:46  partial sour, parchment, floaters, immatures, withered shell, broken
20:52  chipped, cut, um, in slight insect damage, hole, husk. All right, those are
20:58  pictures of those over there. Again, I'm sorry this isn't more high def. It's probably a little bit hard to see, but
21:04  um that's kind of your table of defects, right? So, when you green grade coffee,
21:10  like the first picture I showed you, you are basically laying that 350 g sample,
21:15  you're kind of sorting through one by one by one by one and sorting out any
21:20  defects you find in that 350 g sample. And you might take multiple passes um to
21:25  sort those out. And then you'll get an idea of like, okay, how many defects are present? You know, does it knock it out
21:32  of specialty range? Is this actually a problem for this lot of coffee? How much sorting do we need to do maybe post
21:39  milling, right, before that coffee is exported or before we're sending samples to a potential buyer? Um, this is this
21:47  is a very important thing um at the the green or at the um kind of like the export level, right? when you're trying
21:54  to sell coffee. Um, this helps you identify what's going on with the lot that maybe you were just delivered by a
22:00  farmer. Um, we'll talk about that a little bit more before we move on. Um,
22:07  so yeah, those are those are your defect classification. Again, flaws will
22:12  happen. It's seeing it consistently within a sample that becomes um concerning. So,
22:19  why do people green grade? Why are we green grading? Well, sellers of coffee,
22:25  you know, people at the milling level, exporters, they will green grade for different reasons than a buyer will,
22:32  right? For sellers, yield factor is really, really, really important. So again, a farmer delivers their coffee to
22:39  an exporter. That exporter will pull a sample and they will green grade it and
22:44  they will basically be able to see from this 350 gram sample what is the percent
22:49  loss I can anticipate from milling and sorting this coffee. That tells me the
22:55  yield factor, right? The weight change from the received coffee to the actual final product that will be sold. That is
23:02  very very very important in terms of knowing how much coffee you have to sell and what price we can sell this coffee
23:08  for, right? how much work we're going to have to do to sort this coffee or just knowing how defective that coffee might
23:15  be and whether it's a specialty lot or not. Right? So that's yield factor.
23:21  There are country uh specific trade specs. Right? This uh chart is available
23:26  on our website um if you go to the education tab and then green coffee. Um but different charts or different
23:33  countries um have different specifications for what allows a coffee to even be commodity grade, right? Um
23:41  and so color is important with some places. Um screen size is very very
23:47  important in most places. Defects allowed. The elevation the coffee is grown at might put it into a different
23:54  grade. Um so yeah, this is Brazil, Bundi, Colombia. like every country's commodity market has kind of their own
24:01  specifications based on their country's coffee, right? Um and yeah, we can make
24:06  milling adjustments and determine whether or not a lot is specialty. So that's why sellers green grade,
24:12  right? Every country's got specs. Um I can pull that up on our break too and and send you the URL if you want to look
24:18  at that. But for buyers, um we might green grade if something
24:24  just seems off, right? if it feels like there's more um defects than expected or
24:31  to verify the quality of a sample or to make adjustments to the roast profile,
24:37  right? Density has a big impact on roast. Screen size has a big impact on roast. So, green grading can kind of
24:44  give you a little bit more context for what you might want to do with that coffee or what it might be good for. Um,
24:51  like I said, green grading is really, really important at kind of a buying level, but after a coffeey's been
24:57  purchased, um, you know, like like I said, after we've purchased a coffee at importance, we're not going through and
25:03  green grading every single lot we receive. Um, unless something shows up on the cupping table, that's really
25:09  alarming and that's very, very, very rare. So, those are our physical characteristics, right? You've got an
25:16  entire lot of coffee. You can learn about the density, the screen size, the moisture content, and the defect count
25:22  of that coffee. Cool. That's what green grading is good for. Physical characteristics.
25:30  Up next, what about is what's inside the coffee, right? We can get kind of a good
25:36  profile of the physical um uh characteristics of coffee, but what is actually inside green coffee? How does
25:43  it transform in the roast? And how does that relate to flavor? Um, this is where I spent most of the time on this class
25:50  because I this is where I feel like a concrete understanding of the compounds
25:57  that are inside of coffee, the actual composition, the chemical composition of coffee um, gives us so much insight into
26:04  why coffee tastes the way it does, why it transforms the way it does, and and how we perceive it, right? Um, and to
26:11  me, this is the part of coffee that's more important than the physical characteristics. Great, we know the
26:17  screen size, but what is actually inside of the seed? Um, and how does that relate to the variety, the process, the
26:23  farm, um, and the focus on quality, right? Cool. It's 11:30 here. Um,
26:32  should we take a break? Let's get through this section here and then we'll take a break before we kind of get into sensory analysis if that sounds good.
26:40  So, um, when trying to kind of organize these green coffee compounds, I wanted
26:46  to categorize them. And there's multiple ways you could categorize them. Um, but I decided to categorize them based on
26:52  kind of like what they contribute to the final cup. So, here are the categories
26:58  of compounds. We have organic acids. We have minerals and salts. We have
27:05  sugars. We have bitter components. Um, and this is a whole mix of things. It's
27:10  not as specific as sugar, salt, or acid, right? Lots of things in coffee are bitter. So, I've lumped that all
27:16  together. Structural components are components that make up the actual seed structure. Those that's not really
27:22  related to flavor, but we have textural components, things that contribute to actual mouth feel or body. And then
27:29  aromatics, aroma precursors, volatile aromatics fall into here. So, these are
27:34  the compounds in green coffee. Let's dive into each and every one of these sections and kind of learn what is in
27:40  coffee at the green level, not necessarily the roasted level, but what has this seed developed through ripening
27:48  fruit and then what is it maintained or gained in processing and then what has been preserved in drying and milling,
27:55  right? lots of uh there's a big journey coffee goes through and so tons of
28:00  changes like at a uh tons of like chemical changes are happening in the
28:06  seed right so what do we have by the time maybe we have coffee in hand ready to roast so let's go through organic
28:11  acids by weight organic acids make up about 5% of green coffee
28:18  by weight percentages are very very very very approximate right different varieties are going to have totally
28:23  different by weight percentages But around 5% of the seed, right, to give you kind of a sense of scale, is an
28:29  organic acid. Um, organic acids are defined as an acid that contains a carbon atom. Very simple organic acids
28:37  include citric, malic, quinneic, acetic, formic. All of these occur in coffee, right? We know these kind of flavor
28:44  compounds, right? We experience them in other foods. Coffee can produce just
28:50  about any simple organic acid that any other fruit can, which is really cool. Um these are small simple molecules,
28:57  highly extractable. Um they contribute to sourness. A lot of them survive the
29:02  roast. Then there's chlorogenic acids. Um these are just really complex acid
29:09  chains, but they're still organic acids. They're just kind of a different subgroup. Um
29:15  so cafeic quinic acid esters, those break down um into lots of different
29:21  things in the roast. Um, chlorogenic acids are really important in roasting. They create a lot of new things because
29:27  they are such complex molecular chains. Um, some uh, chlorogenic acids become
29:33  super bitter. Some break down into more acidicy acidity things and some break down into more aromatic things, but I
29:40  lumped them all here. But yeah, you can see the difference in a citric acid molecule versus a neochlorogenic acid
29:45  molecule, right? that similar structure is present um in here, but it has a lot
29:52  of extra stuff on it and so it really degrades into different things in the roast.
29:58  Um so those are organic acids, right? That's where we get our sourness and our tartness. Next, we've got minerals.
30:05  Minerals are imbued into the seed because plants need minerals to survive. Everything needs minerals to survive.
30:11  It's what hydrates us, right? It's why we put um hydration sticks in our water.
30:16  They're full of potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, those kinds of things.
30:23  Um minerals are very very occur in very small amounts like 1% of a seed, but
30:30  they survive the roast and they do contribute like a touch of saltiness to the final cup. Right? We've probably all
30:36  had cups of coffee that are a little salty. Um and that's kind of the combination of acid and salt together.
30:42  Um but mineral salts are compounds where minerals have combined with other elements. So for example, potassium
30:48  phosphate, magnesium sulfate. Um all of these things again they survive the
30:53  roast. Um and so we get um this kind of salty flavor in the final cup because of
30:58  these minerals that are in the seed. Sugars, a very important one. Um sugars
31:05  make up 8 to 12% of an Arabica seed. Um the big one is sucrose. There are
31:12  there's lots of sucrossse in coffee. Um sucrossse is a bonded glucose and fructose sugar molecule. So in roasting
31:19  sucrose tends to break down into glucose and fructose. Um it is in the seed uh
31:27  sugars are necessary because they are a huge um fuel source for the seed as it
31:33  is developing a new plant. Right? When seeds go to create new an entire new
31:38  plant, they need energy. Um, and sugar is a big part of that. Um, enzymes in
31:45  the seed break down that stuff into consumable packages of glucose and fructose. Um, and that's similar to what
31:53  happens in the roast. As I've already mentioned, these are highly active in caramelization in the meired reaction in
31:59  the roast. Right? So, um, sucrose is kind of like cane sugar level sweetness.
32:05  Um, fructose becomes really sweet, um, more like honey. Um, while glucose becomes, uh, a lot less sweet. Um,
32:14  uh, I'm trying to think, is there anything else here? Yeah, it's germination fuel. Um,
32:20  and it helps with a lot of other stuff in the plant. Sugar is very necessary in this coffee seed.
32:27  bitters, bitter compounds. Caffeine is bitter. Um, it's produced as a natural pesticide within the plant. Um, it
32:35  survives roasting, extracts easily. Um, uh, there's actually like a handful of
32:40  things like trigenoline that is also a natural pesticide that is produced in coffee. Um, not many plants produce
32:47  caffeine though. This is definitely an evolutionary trait. Um, uh, uh, trigonoline. Um it is a vitamin
32:56  B3 plus methyl um group compound. Um it contributes to bitterness and then again
33:03  chlorogenic acids resurface here. Um they can be very astringent after
33:08  they've been roasted. So those are kind of our bitter compounds. Aromatic compounds. This is a big group.
33:15  Um this is by no means an extensive list. Um but these are kind of your your subgroups. aldahhides and ketones,
33:21  furins, pyazines. Um, this is kind of their structure, but um they contribute
33:29  to a lot of different stuff and they're going to have totally different aroma profiles, right? Aroma precursors occur
33:35  in the thousands in coffee and they um change and more are developed in the
33:42  roast. Um, and this is where we get a huge amount of the flavor notes that we experience in coffee, right? like um
33:49  what it said wine has has somewhere close to like 300 aroma precursors um while coffee has you know 2,000 aroma
33:57  precursors or something like that. Don't quote me on those exact numbers, but coffee has one of the most complex
34:04  single ingredients because it can mimic so many different aromomas, right? Or it produces so many aromomas. So this is a
34:10  huge group, less than 1% by weight, but a massive massive group. these esters.
34:17  Um, and then things that contribute to texture, lipids and oils. Um, uh, and
34:25  then amino acids and proteins in the roast. These, um, all kind of maintain a
34:30  solid form. And then they are hydrophobic, right? They don't dissolve in water, so they are pulled out in
34:36  their their their physical form into the final cup, right? We see oils floating on the surface of the coffee in in
34:42  certain brew methods. And so we feel these as a tactile weight, right? Um
34:48  lipids and oils are even more important than sugar um as a fuel reserve. There's
34:53  more calories per gram in lipids than there is in fructose. Um they are
34:59  essential for forming cell me main membranes and then containing moisture for the coffee as well. Um, so the the
35:08  plant, the new plant, you know, it consumes this stuff as it's growing.
35:13  Amino acids and proteins, these are kind of like the building blocks of the seed itself. Um, uh, they create the
35:21  framework of cells that store nutrients. Um, and these break down um, and they
35:27  can create like nuttier flavors, but they also contribute to texture. Um, I'm
35:33  trying to think is there's anything else that's important to say here. I think that's it. Last, your structural
35:40  compound, right? So, we've kind of talked about how I'll go back real quick. Amino acids, proteins, those kind
35:47  of help form this structure. These are called cells, right? Cells are these open spaces. And then all of the stuff
35:54  that tastes good and the plant needs to survive is with held within these cells. So the things that actually make up that
36:01  structure is cellulose which are glucose chains um that are linked together by by
36:06  a straight fiber um think of it like the rebar of um you know a building that's
36:13  being created. Hemiselulose is a mixed um sugar chain that fills the spaces
36:19  between cellulose and then um lignen um is a polyphenolic compounds that coat
36:25  the cellulose chain kind of like a sealant. So you've kind of got your rebar, your mortar and your your sealant
36:31  that kind of creates that entire um pocket. Um
36:36  all three it says are nearly resistant um to break down and roasting. Right? If
36:42  they broke down in roasting, we wouldn't have anything in the final product, right? They hold their structure. They're very strong. They don't really
36:48  do anything to the final brew. They are the structure of the seed.
36:54  So, those are green coffee compounds. But for a quick recap, we've got green
37:01  grading, physical analysis, right? We're just looking at density, moisture,
37:07  screen size, and uh defects. Um we then
37:12  investigated a little deeper into like, okay, cool. What's inside of the coffee? Acids, salt, sugars, bitters, um
37:19  aromatic compounds, texture compounds, and then the structure of the seed. So,
37:26  all of these things interact in a roster. They all matter in roasting. Um, we're not going to go through roasting
37:31  details today really. We're going to kind of skip to cupping. Um, because,
37:36  you know, green grading is physical analysis. Cupping is sensory analysis. Um, so we're going to skip over roasting
37:44  a little bit. Um, and we're going to talk about roasting and brewing in tomorrow's class. So, we'll tackle some
37:49  of that stuff there. Um, but this kind of sets the stage again for what we're we're analyzing um, when it comes to
37:56  sensory stuff. But to be able to even taste these things, this green raw
38:03  unroasted seed does have to be roasted, right? So, we got to drop it into our sample roaster. Um, sample roasting is
38:11  basically roasting with as little intervention as possible. You're roasting pretty light because you don't
38:18  want to taste any of the roast. You just want to taste what the seed has. So for us, every single roast, sample roast
38:26  that we do, basically every coffee is dropped into the same temperature drum. We don't mess
38:34  with any airflow or any fuel throughout the roast. We just let the coffee go and then we get the coffee out of the
38:40  roaster at a certain amount of time or a certain amount of development after
38:46  first crack. And it's very little development. We're going to talk about those variables tomorrow, but all this
38:53  to say is as little intervention as possible. We want to our sample rows to be repeatable, right? When we're talking
39:00  about analysis, um we are want wanting to do something that we can do the same
39:05  way every single time, right? As few changing variables as possible. So, um
39:11  sample roasting is a standardized light roast of around 100 gram. 100 grams is
39:16  is about standard. Some people might do 150 200, some people might do 50 because
39:22  there's more and more roasters nowadays that can do different amounts.
39:27  Um, but yeah, 50 to 150. Um, 100 grams is your standard size. So like this kind
39:32  of like old school um more old school roster. This is what you used to see in all the sensory labs and you still see
39:38  them very commonly is to 100 grams. This is what we used to roast on in our lab. We now use these roasts um uh where you
39:47  get tons of data. You can track all the data points of the coffee. Um but yeah, again the idea is minimal adjustment so
39:53  you can repeat the profile over and over. Um and get a good read on like what is actually going on inside of this
40:00  coffee. Right. There's nawa. These do 50 grams. Um and uh yeah, this is an air
40:07  roaster. So a different kind. Yeah, lots of lots of different roers nowadays. But
40:13  again, we're going to kind of skip over roasting and get to cupping. After sample roasting, we are cupping the
40:18  coffee. Um, this is this is our good friend Scott in our sensory lab. All these people are are from our sensory
40:24  lab. Sensory is a huge part of what we do as importers and it's for a different
40:29  reason maybe than many roasters. Um, right. So, just like green grading,
40:34  different people have different reasons and therefore will follow different protocols um based on their needs.
40:41  Right. cupping for us. We cup um you know
40:46  offers which are basically coffee we have not bought but people are trying to sell us. So there's offers um that we'll
40:54  cup in our sensory labs and our green buyers are cupping it. Then if we buy a coffee we will cup a pre-hipped sample,
41:02  right? So after all the coffee has been mil, we get a sample before it's exported and we cup that. Then we cup it
41:08  upon arrival and then we will cup coffees um I think every two or three
41:13  months that it sits in our warehouse. As long as the coffee is there still in our inventory, we will continue to cup it.
41:20  So we cup a lot, right? And for us, it's about um describing what that coffee is
41:26  like um and basically being able to accurately then give that description to
41:32  a roaster so a roaster kind of knows what they're dealing with and then roasters can taste it. So there's
41:37  there's cupping for buying, there's um cupping for seeing how a coffee is
41:43  changing in storage um or how a coffee changed, you know, pre and post milling
41:49  or pre and post shipment. Um, and then there's, you know, cupping for, um,
41:55  creating a roast, right, for developing a coffee. Um, figuring out like, hm, how
42:01  do I actually want to roast this coffee to make it its best potential version, right? Um, or even cupping brews, actual
42:08  pourovers on bar maybe, right? There's lots of different reasons. for us um and for most of the industry,
42:15  cupping, um established by the Q- grading system, which we've talked about before. Um step one, you're weighing out
42:22  your sample, right? It's a certain coffee to water ratio. We cup in little uh Gibralar cups instead of like those
42:27  larger cupping bowls. So, we weigh out 9 g of coffee instead of 13, um which is more common. Um you fill that cup to the
42:35  brim, right, with your 205 water. You start the timer as soon as you do that. You extract the coffee for 4 minutes.
42:42  four-minute brew time. Then you kind of like stir across the surface, right? You
42:47  break that crust that has formed at four minutes. Um the grounds kind of sink. At
42:53  that point, the water is cool enough to where the coffee is no longer really extracting. Um and then you will clean
43:01  off any of that, you know, frothiness, um and residual grounds off the top of the cup surface. Allow that coffee to
43:08  cool. um you know, you want it at least below 140 so you're not burning your mouth. And then you're tasting that
43:14  coffee and evaluating it through whatever system of evaluation you follow. And that's what we're going to
43:20  talk about next. Sensory analysis. This has been a hot topic, right? We have a new Q-grading
43:26  system. It's officially happened. We have the CVA, a new sensory form that
43:31  kind of like breaks the legacy cupping form we've used since 1984. Um, sensory
43:38  analysis is different from cupping. We'll say that right there. Sensory analysis is a scientific diff discipline
43:45  that's been used for years and years and years and years, right? To figure out what do consumers like? Um, that's kind
43:51  of sensory analysis. And there's lots of different tests in sensory analysis, but we do call cupping, you know, a
43:58  scientific discipline. And that's where coffee is a science. So, we're going to kind of talk about like how coffeey's um
44:05  sensory analysis has changed over the years, what's wrong with it, what's right with it, what works, what doesn't
44:12  work, and how we can all use cupping and change how we cup um to achieve the goal
44:18  that we are trying to set out to do. Right? We all cup for different reasons. How do we best achieve that goal? So
44:26  um sensory analysis is a discipline used to evoke, to measure, to analyze and
44:32  interpret reactions to food, beverage, whatever. Um and in many disciplines,
44:38  it's all about sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing, right? The entire environment affects our perception of a
44:45  product. Um some industries are far more concerned with environmental things. So
44:51  everything impacts the human senses obviously right just in the moment where we are eliminating our psychology from
44:58  it um sound touch appearance and texture all impact flavor and flavor itself is
45:05  made up of taste aroma um and try sensors. So
45:10  um different kinds of tests, sensory tests um or purposes of those tests may
45:17  change variables to one or all of the above for the sake of market research. Um understanding a buyer trend uh market
45:25  preferences in different regions, right? Like you'll have different t test subjects. Um but yeah, you know, sound
45:33  emission has an impact on how we um perceive things. Um how something feels,
45:39  you know, before we've even tasted it affects its flavor. Um appearance is a
45:44  massive thing, right? If we see what it looks like, that informs our expectation
45:49  of what it will taste like, right? Stronger color, we expect a stronger flavor. Um, and then yeah, you've got
45:57  taste, aroma, and then trigamal, which is kind of like uh, you know, like I
46:04  don't know how you would, what's the word I'm thinking of here? Trigamal sensors um, are for things that are more
46:11  like like we would think of it as like bad um, or maybe poisonous. Um, I'm
46:18  trying to what's the word? I'm like over here. A triomeal nerve. Um yeah, it
46:26  can't remember what kind of stuff falls into track. It's like bad stuff basically. There's bad tastes obviously bad aromas, but um these things kind of
46:33  all inform flavor, right? All this leads to flavor in coffee. Um we're not super
46:38  concerned with appearance, sound or touch, right? We're not recording that stuff in a cupping. We're also not
46:44  always, you know, doing things entirely to our environment to make our
46:50  environment the same no matter where we are, right? We cup in different rooms in different countries across the board. We
46:56  try to make it, you know, we try not to play music. We try not to, you know,
47:01  we're not cooking eggs in the corner of a cupping. We're not like, you know, trying to um change the atmosphere or
47:08  affect the sensory experience, but we also aren't recording those kinds of things either, right? Um we are
47:14  concerned with texture, triaminal, aroma, taste, and all how that contributes to flavor, right? It's
47:20  purely the experience right in front of our face or inside of our face. Right?
47:27  So let's talk about flavor a little bit because we've defined sensor analysis. Let's define flavor. Flavor is the
47:33  sensation produced um by you know perceiving something in the mouth by the
47:38  senses of taste, smell, um the general tactile experience, temperature receptors in our mouth, right? Our mouth
47:46  is a is a a touch organ. We can feel the weight of it and then we have taste and smell interacting with us as well.
47:52  Right? Flavor is the sum of all of these characteristics. So you can break flavor
47:58  out into taste, aroma, body. Let's define the three of these real quick. Taste is chemical. So
48:06  you know when we talk about the compounds in coffee, acids, salts, sugars, and bitters, that kind of whole
48:13  right side of the chart, those are tastes chemical. Um those are molecules
48:18  and we perceive those on our pallet, right? Sweet, sour, salty, bitter. Um and savory are the big five tastes,
48:26  right? Um so it's not about apple, pineapple, chocolate, nuts, right? It's
48:33  purely sweet, sour, salty, bitter. We all perceive these things um because we
48:39  all have uh ple on our tongue um that detect these things, right? Our taste
48:45  buds. Um each bud on our tongue contains 200 to a thousand receptor cells. Each
48:53  cell within a taste bud um is usually devoted to one kind of taste. Um soury
48:59  things, salty things, sweet things, bitter things, umami things, right? So
49:05  um there's no like zones of our tongue necessarily, but different taste buds um might have a higher concentration of
49:12  certain kinds of cells. So taste purely a pallet thing. Sweet, sour, salty,
49:18  bitter, umami. Then we've got smell or aroma. This one is the primary
49:26  driver of why we experience flavor notes, right? Like taste is a very small
49:32  percentage of the entire flavor experience. Aroma is where most of the experience comes from. And it's because
49:38  aroma hits straight to the brain. Um it is things we are smelling you know
49:45  outside of our our nose or inside of our mouth. It goes straight into our olfactory system which is linked into
49:52  our brain. Right? we are literally taking in particles into our olfactory system and that information hits the
50:00  olfactory bulb um and it's going to gets passed into the lyic system um where
50:06  that information is immediately decoded um and the more we taste or the more we
50:12  smell something the stronger that smell is coded into our brain the easier it is
50:19  to recall that smell right the more familiar we become come with it. Um so
50:26  uh olfactory neurons pass this information straight to our brain after um those compounds are basically trapped
50:34  or captured in our olfactory bulb. It's kind of like putting a key into the lock and all of a sudden it fires on that
50:40  olfactory neuron and it's linked again to our lyic system. Our lyic system is
50:45  responsible for emotions, behaviors, memory, right? Smell is deeply, deeply,
50:51  deeply important to survival. It's the only way animals know where to go, where
50:57  to avoid, what food's good, how to do things, who their family is, right? And it's the same thing with us. It's deeply
51:03  ingrained in our survival. Um, uh, I think this quote kind of like, you know,
51:09  encapsulates why smell, um, is so important. Oldfaction closely couples to other functions like gestation, right?
51:16  taking something in our mouth, taste, and also involuntary memory formation. Right? We know smell brings up memory um
51:23  in a very strong way. From an evolutionary standpoint, sense of smell is critical for evaluating safety, um
51:31  assessing danger, and recognizing social relationships, right? If we didn't have smell, a lot of our life would be
51:37  really, really difficult. So aroma is deeply important and aroma
51:43  is a huge part of what makes coffee what it is. Then last is tactile or body. So
51:49  um pressure, traction, um temperature can play into this. Um but in coffee we
51:55  think about weight and texture, right? How heavy that coffee feels, but also just the actual tactile experience of
52:02  it, right? Something more rough versus something soft, something round, silky, syrupy, smooth, creamy, right? all those
52:09  kinds of words. So again, taste, aroma, body. Taste is
52:15  the chemical reaction, sweet, sour, salty, bitter. Body is the physical interaction on our touch organ. And then
52:22  aroma is the whole kind of brain perception interaction with smell,
52:28  right? All of this informs flavor. So
52:33  those things like if I were to go back to this real quick like aroma particularly is kind of like deeply
52:40  personal. All of us have had unique experiences throughout our life. Um but
52:46  also there's also like errors that can happen when we're tasting things over and over. This is something I never
52:52  heard about in coffee, but it's very very very important in sensory analysis.
52:57  Um, there are physiological and psychological sensory errors that we are all susceptible to because we're human.
53:03  In sensory analysis, setting up a test that limits these
53:09  errors is extremely important. And I think these are great to look at for
53:14  coffee professionals because then you can start to detect them when they're happening in a cupping and control for
53:20  them. We have a whole series of blogs our sensory our head of sensory Ian has written um on this but uh there's a lot
53:27  of errors adaptation right the more and more sweet things you taste the less and
53:33  less sweet we start to perceive things right you've had so much sweet on your pallet that things start to taste less
53:40  sweet than they actually are um or having a lot of sweet things and then all sudden having something bitter makes
53:47  that bitter thing seem way more bitter than it actually is, right? Salt enhances our perception of sweetness.
53:55  Um, it suppresses the perception of sour, right? So, you think about a cupping table. How often do we encounter
54:01  these kinds of errors? If we taste natural, natural, natural, natural, washed, that washed is not going to
54:08  taste very sweet after you've had a bunch of naturals. And those naturals
54:13  will also maybe tone one another down. Or the opposite will happen. Those naturals will tone each other down. and
54:20  that washed will stick out as something super special because it's way different than everything that's preceded it.
54:25  Right? So, um the diet 100%. What you've eaten before cupping very important and
54:33  this is that kind of links over to psychological errors, right? So, psychological is more about expectations
54:40  and perception and less about you know how sugar, salt and acid interacts on our pallet. So, information given with a
54:47  sample may trigger preconceived ideas. Any information in a cupping we know about a coffee informs how we expect
54:55  that coffee to taste. If you know something's a natural, well, you're going to expect it to taste fruity,
55:00  right? And you're probably going to write some fruity notes down on your cupping form, even if it's not the
55:06  fruiest natural you've ever had, right? Like, just knowing that forms a lot of expectation, and that's
55:13  really important in flavor. We'll kind of address that in a second. Logical error when two or more characteristics
55:18  of the samplers are associated in the minds of assessors. Right? So if you can see the seeds, the roasted coffee and we
55:26  know that large beans are typically less acidic than small. If we can see the coffee, that's too much information. We
55:32  are already expecting something, right? Um stimulus error cupping the top 10.
55:37  You expect it to be amazing. So you probably score it more amazing than you would otherwise. Um, so, um, there's
55:46  lots of psychological errors. There's a whole another group here. Um, pattern effect.
55:53  Let's see here. I'm I'm echoing a little bit. There we go. Building flights from mild to intense um is a problem. You
56:00  don't want to do that. Um, so what we're seeing here is that if you know anything, if there's patterns um, uh, or
56:10  like some sort of like nonrandom setup, it can heavily impact um, how you score
56:18  something or how you interpret something. Going back to your comment, uh, JRA, if I pronounced your name
56:23  correctly, time error, positional bias, one's attitude underos subtle changes over a series of tests, right? So if
56:29  you're hungry, if you're fatigued or indifferent, you're going to score it differently, right? So this is something
56:36  that we have thought about a lot in our cupping experience, right? Um in our
56:44  sensory lab, we don't want to be biased. We want to know that cool. If I come in on Monday and I write orange on my
56:53  cupping sheet, I am going to assign it the same amount of value as I will on Thursday when I come and encounter that
57:00  kind of similar orange, but I'm in a totally different mood. Right? So mood
57:06  every everything affects how we value things in coffee. This is really important because
57:13  all of this deeply personal stuff um can affect how we are interpreting
57:19  what we are presented. And in coffee, the presentation or the flavor of
57:24  something deeply impacts the price and that price deeply impacts somebody's livelihood. And this has always been the
57:31  challenge of specialty coffee, right? Um something that is so subjective as flavor can have such a strong bearing on
57:39  how much money somebody makes in a year. Um and so who is assigning meaning? Who is saying what is specialty? Who is
57:46  saying what is high quality? Um who's participating in that dialogue? How are people calibrated? Right? All of that
57:53  sort of stuff is really really important. So um again flavor is an
57:59  integrated perceptual experience if you were to kind of give it a scientific quick term that results from gustatory
58:07  um olfactory and trigamal stimuli um with aroma or that um olfactory sense
58:14  being the dominant contributor. Um, so it's about perception, right? The more
58:20  we know about it, the more meaning we've assigned to it, the more neuronal firing that happens, the more we expect
58:25  something, the more we'll actually taste that thing, right? Perception, um, you
58:31  know, it's a proactive process. And so the experience of flavor is heavily built up in our brains, right? Because
58:36  it's linked to aroma. We all have unique histories and perceptions. And so we can
58:42  never really understand how somebody is perceiving something um compared to us, right? People spend years working in the
58:49  same company becoming more and more calibrated over time as their experiences and expectations become more
58:55  calibrated. Um but that's where the question is like for us at least how do
59:00  we evoke, measure, analyze, and interpret something that's inherently subjective, right? How can we make this
59:06  a more objective test? Um that's really really important, right? So how we test,
59:13  how we cup, um, determines how valid the data we are getting out of that cupping
59:20  is, right? So these are components of a sensory test. We're kind of back in that sensory analysis world, the scientific
59:27  discipline, and we're trying to relate it to cupping. Um, it all stems from the objective. What are we trying to learn?
59:34  What are we trying to do with this test? Right? that will inform the kind of test
59:40  we're carrying out, who is going to participate and what we should do to the environment that this is occurring.
59:46  Right? The objective is very important in sensory analysis. Um that tells you
59:52  how to carry out the entire test. Then you can collect that data from that
59:57  test. You can know it's reliable and that can give you good information. Right? The problem with coffee is
1:00:03  oftentimes we have multiple objectives. We want to describe the experience of the coffee, but we also want to score
1:00:10  the experience. That's two totally different things, two totally different objectives. That should require two
1:00:17  different kinds of tests, right? So, different kinds of tests. We have objective or analytical. Um, we
1:00:24  have subjective or hyonic. Objective tests are simply asking what is this
1:00:30  product like? I'm trying to figure out what does this taste like? typically panels of small groups of trained
1:00:36  tasters, people who are trained to describe a product. Subjective tests are the main question
1:00:44  is, do people like this product? I'm not trying to learn what the product tastes like. I'm trying to find out, do you
1:00:50  like it? Panels here are typically large numbers of untrained consumers, right?
1:00:58  The consumer you're trying to sell to. So, do we kind of see there's already a disconnect here? In coffee, we want to
1:01:05  do both, but they're totally totally different forms of testing when we're in a sensory analysis world, right? Um, so
1:01:12  there's those objective test examples are discrimination. Triangulation is an
1:01:18  objective test. Two coffees are the same, one coffee is different. Taste those three samples and try and find the
1:01:24  one that's different. Right? Um, we are learning about the coffee. A descriptive
1:01:29  test um we are describing properties and their perceived intensity. Right? So
1:01:36  somebody just saying okay the acidity is intense or medium intense or low intense
1:01:43  that is somebody describing a coffee. When we get into liking, ranking scoring
1:01:51  a coffee um then we are no longer learning really about the coffee. We are
1:01:58  learning about the taster, right? We are discovering whether somebody likes it or not. That is subjective, right? That's
1:02:06  what we talked about. Typically, this is for um testing consumers and if somebody likes a product. But this is what we do
1:02:12  in COE cuppings. It's what we do in the older sea cupping form. Right? So, we're
1:02:19  not really learning about the coffee when we're saying 8.25. We're learning about what the taster
1:02:25  thinks about a coffee, right? Um so again, these are two different tests.
1:02:31  Cupping is admittedly both tests at once and it always has been. Um right, Ted
1:02:39  Lingal, the Coffee Cupers Handbook in 1984 said cupping is a method used to systematically evaluate the aroma,
1:02:45  taste, and texture characteristics of a sample of beans. That's objective. or just um evaluating or describing.
1:02:54  But in SCEA, a new system to assess coffee value, this is their newest
1:03:00  definition of cupping. It is a method for the sensory assessment of coffee, which involves tasting several cups per
1:03:07  sample using a different set of coffee beans for each cup, which is ground and brewed independently. The purpose of a
1:03:12  cupping may be to do a descriptive assessment, objective, an effective assessment, subjective, or both
1:03:20  combined. Here's a paper.
1:03:25  Misuse of sensory tests can occur when more than one sensory test objective is
1:03:30  combined in a single test. For a long long long time, coffee has been doing two modes of thinking at one time. and
1:03:39  bias can come into play very very heavily when we're doing that. So all
1:03:44  that to say again is that cupping isn't sensory analysis. Cupping is not a
1:03:49  science. What we are trying to do is basically
1:03:54  create um a quality test where anybody
1:04:00  who's tasting are highly trained and knowledgeable of their product. Right? This goes back to coffee is like a
1:04:06  discipline where we want to learn more. Everybody who cups, everybody in the industry, we want to learn more about
1:04:11  coffee. So, I'm not saying that cupping is bad. Um, but we do need to recognize that often times we are doing two tests
1:04:18  at once. Um, and that's not necessarily scientific, right? And so it becomes
1:04:23  very difficult to assign value, right? When our biases is is coming into play.
1:04:29  We started to recognize this and that's why we have completely changed how we cup at Cafe Imports. And I'm not here to
1:04:34  say you should do it how we do it. But I like making people aware of these things because we can start to control for bias
1:04:41  a little better and we can start to communicate between buyer and seller a little bit better too as well. Um
1:04:49  so we are doing quality testing in coffee. We are not doing subjective or objective. We are doing quality testing
1:04:56  because we're trying to do both. The CVA admittedly does that. The new form broke
1:05:03  out subjective and objective tests into two different sheets of paper, but the
1:05:08  taster is still doing both at once, right? So, they tried to make it look like sensory science, but it's not sensory science. None of what coffee has
1:05:15  done is ever has ever been sensory science, right? And that that poses problems.
1:05:21  But what has cupping in these forms been good for? Asking questions. asking what
1:05:27  a coffee tastes like and giving us a format to talk about it, right? Creating a language. We've created an entire
1:05:34  language in how we describe coffee, you know, aroma, um, acidity, sweetness,
1:05:40  bitterness, aftertaste, flavor, balance, like all of these words that we've used
1:05:46  forever. We created a language with these forms, right? They're great training tools. Um, there are better
1:05:52  training tools out there when you focus on one thing at a time. Um but and then we've used them for comparison, right?
1:05:58  Maybe comparison to ourself, comparison to one another. Um figuring out how to
1:06:04  calibrate with one another, right? They're not all bad. We've created an entire language of around coffee with
1:06:09  these things. But coffee recognizes its shortcomings and that's why it will probably continue to evolve. It's why
1:06:16  the sea evolved it. It's why it's going to continue to evolve um into the future, right? I think at the end of the
1:06:23  day, we all want to better assign value and communicate value to people with totally different experiences other than
1:06:30  ourselves. Um, for sure. So, we made the coffee rose for our own cupping. Like I
1:06:36  said, we saw these problems. We wanted to make our cupping objective. We don't
1:06:41  want our sensory team going in one day and saying peach equals 8 1/2 and then
1:06:47  the next day saying peach equals 9.25. We want to say that peach every day no
1:06:53  matter our mood equals the same score. Period. And we can show you that um if
1:06:59  you are a producer, a seller, a customer, whoever you are, right? Um so
1:07:04  we we have tried to basically eliminate as much error as possible. Um and this
1:07:10  is a program that is free to use. So if you don't like the CVA or if you want to
1:07:15  try something new, I highly recommend trying this out. It's free to use. It's our cupping form. It's basically a
1:07:21  flavor wheel that you tap on. It gets bigger and bigger and expands and becomes more and more specific as you
1:07:26  continue going from fruity to berry tropical. You know, you get more
1:07:34  categories until you're very specific, right? So, specificity
1:07:39  um the more specific of an input, the greater impact on score. Um,
1:07:45  uh, notes at the same specificity level are weighted uniquely, meaning different
1:07:52  flavor notes are weighted differently in the scoring engine, whether it's a washed, natural, or honey, and what we
1:07:58  expect from that coffee, right? So, expectations are considered. And then intensity, for every flavor note you
1:08:04  input, you have to select an intensity. Um, and in the intensity is always in
1:08:10  reference to a flat 80. Every single cupping we do at Cafe Imports, we have
1:08:15  um a what we call a flat 80. It's basically a washed central American 80
1:08:21  point coffee, right? And then we taste everything else next to it um and able
1:08:26  to have a reference point, right? Um reference points are really important to limit um bias um and and errors. So, um,
1:08:36  the whole idea here is our cupers are just describing things on this virtual,
1:08:41  um, rows or this virtual, uh, flavor wheel. They're just selecting what they taste and the intensity. That's all our
1:08:48  cupers do. They clear the table, but the back end, the scoring engine, um,
1:08:55  basically creates that descriptor string and then scores that coffee for you. So,
1:09:00  we do not score coffee in our lab. We have a scoring engine that that handles that that we worked a long time to kind
1:09:06  of kind of figure out like how weighted should every single hundreds of flavor
1:09:11  notes be um based on its process. So this is where it's like people are starting to think of new ways. I can't
1:09:18  take any credit for this. Um people are thinking of new ways um to basically
1:09:24  score coffee, right? And be able to communicate value. um you can't
1:09:29  communicate your expectations um but you can communicate a spreadsheet of values
1:09:35  assigned to flavor descriptors right so that was our goal with this I don't want this to be a huge plug but um
1:09:43  if you want to mess with this uh you can make an account in our portal and then you have it um you create
1:09:49  flights and keep going what I do want to leave you with here is um some basic
1:09:58  rules rules for making a good cupping test. So
1:10:03  after learning from sensory analysis practices and different tests that are out there, these are the basic rules we
1:10:10  have for cupping that I would give to you. Rule number one, what's your objective? Are you trying to compare
1:10:16  coffees to one another? Are you trying to simply describe the cup? Or are you scoring?
1:10:23  Try and only do one of those things at the time at a time. If you're gonna score, you don't really need to write
1:10:29  down flavor notes. Try and focus on the scoring. Um, and put notes down if you're feeling it, but don't try to
1:10:36  describe as intensely as possible and then go back and score it. Just it's two modes of thinking. Um, and one of them
1:10:43  will will not perform as as high of a level. But define your objective. Is this for buying? Is it for feedback? Is
1:10:50  it for profiling? Is it for putting on bar? Right? Eliminate the unnecessary stuff and just focus on what your
1:10:56  objective is. Two, do everything consistently. Obviously, this is huge, but we are
1:11:02  creating a test in order to eliminate variance and bias. Taste everything you
1:11:08  can in the same place with the same equipment, the same way every single time, right? Um, do everything the same
1:11:16  as possible. um you know throwing up an important cupping on the fly where you
1:11:22  know what everything is and you're using unfamiliar things like that's not very
1:11:27  valid data. If it's something that's deeply important like somebody else's livelihood do everything consistently.
1:11:36  Um taste as blind as possible. This is huge. And this is for even if it's
1:11:42  espresso and you're trying to figure out an espresso recipe or if it's, you know,
1:11:47  um, you know, buying multiple lots of coffee. You need to randomize your
1:11:52  samples. Have them on a random order on the table. Use a randomizer app um or a
1:11:58  spreadsheet or something. Randomize your samples. Have somebody randomize it for you. Have somebody else set up that
1:12:04  tastings. And you should not know what's on the table. Um, if it's coffees maybe that you know,
1:12:13  you know, you're trying to decide if you want to buy them or not, um, put them on the table with other coffees and
1:12:18  randomize it. Coffees you already have, coffees, you know, you're not buying, right? The more you put it amongst other
1:12:24  stuff, the better your data. This isn't something we often take the time to do. Um, but yeah, and if you're tasting, you
1:12:31  know, something on your brew bar in your cafe, um, have somebody prepare the
1:12:37  different kinds and then AB it, right? ABing is a very objective test. It's not
1:12:43  subjective at all if you don't know anything. Um, use a reference if possible. It's
1:12:49  not always possible to have a flat 80 like we do, but I never did this before
1:12:55  working at Cafe Imports. And now, every time I cup, I put a baseline coffee on
1:13:02  the table before everything else. And it resets my pallet and it helps me reestablish, okay, what is baseline
1:13:08  specialty? Therefore, how much more intense or how much more sweet or how
1:13:14  much more fruity or how much longer of an aftertaste does this nice coffee have? Right? We are always able to reset
1:13:22  our expectations. Expectations inform flavor. Um, if you don't have an 80
1:13:28  point, if you're not going to keep, you know, an Excelso Colombia or, you know, a a large regional Mexico lot, um, use
1:13:36  your house blend. You know, that coffee, you love that coffee. Use your house blend, set your bar there, and then cup
1:13:42  against that. Anchor and reference your experience to something you do know is is really important for cupping. Um, not
1:13:50  many people do that, but it's a big one. And then paste everything more than
1:13:55  once. Um, replicate tests to validate your data. Um, is another really
1:14:01  important one. Um, what this means is for us, let's say every day our sensory lab has
1:14:09  four flights of 10 coffees each. That's 40 coffees. They taste five days a week.
1:14:16  Um, and let's say they have to cup through 120 different samples that week.
1:14:22  Those coffees are going to appear on tables throughout the week more than once. It gets you more notes, more
1:14:29  scores, more data, more descriptions, more everything to help you really know
1:14:34  like where is this coffee amongst all the other coffees, right? Replicating tests is another great way to make it
1:14:40  more objective. Um, uh, those are our rules for cupping. So,
1:14:49  some of this sounds like hard work, but again, I think we are working in an industry that wants to be more
1:14:54  transparent. And transparent means everybody should know how everybody's kind of tasting and valuing things,
1:15:00  right? And so, just knowing um I highly recommend reading through all those sensory errors and see like, hm, oh,
1:15:08  this definitely comes up in our cupping protocol. Um, and finding a way to kind of eliminate those sensory errors is a
1:15:14  great great start for making your own test. Right? You don't need to cup five of every coffee. What does that tell
1:15:21  you? Is that part of your objective? We cup one cup of every coffee and then we replicate it throughout the week. Right?
1:15:28  Now, if you're trying to taste for defects in mult in one lot, then maybe you do need to cup, you know, five cups
1:15:35  of one offer. Um, but those are very different objectives, right? We don't
1:15:40  write down aromomas. We don't really care what coffee smells like. We care what coffee tastes like. Right? If you
1:15:46  don't need to do it, eliminate it from your protocol, right? There's no best way to cup. That's why it keeps
1:15:52  changing. It's good to kind of look at what sensory analysis has always done, the science, the discipline of it, and
1:15:58  see what we can apply to our own cuppings in our own labs or on our own bars. So, in review,
1:16:05  let's see. I have some questions here. Um, uh, so far the best part, um, a five.
1:16:12  Thank you, Samuel. I really appreciate that. Um, glad you like this one. And then Lee, with regards to the sample
1:16:19  roasting, we'll discuss that more tomorrow for sure. Um, like I said earlier with sample roasting, we are
1:16:26  setting our roster to the same charge temp every single coffee. And then we
1:16:31  are not adjusting power, fuel, or air flow throughout the roast. The coffee just rides on the temperature it's at.
1:16:39  And then we have a certain percentage of development after first crack that every
1:16:45  coffee reaches and then drops. So we will talk about that more tomorrow. Um
1:16:51  but you can't make every coffee experience the same temperature in the same amount of time, right? So it's more
1:16:57  about same charge temp, same development percentage um for every coffee with no
1:17:03  adjustment in between. um on our old roster, you know, like the old small
1:17:08  probats, we did one uh airflow change. Um and we actually have a video of that
1:17:13  on YouTube, like that process. Um so depending on what roster you're obviously working on, you'll find your
1:17:18  own kind of protocol that seems to work, but yeah. Yeah, we try and not touch anything and then very minimal
1:17:24  development, very light. Okay, so in review, we talked about physical
1:17:30  density, screen size, moisture, defect. Um, we talked about chemical,
1:17:36  um, acid, salt, sugar, bitter. We talked about aroma precursors. We talked about
1:17:41  textural and then we talked about the structure of the seed. All of this will be deeply important with roasting and
1:17:47  brewing tomorrow. Um, but we kind of skipped over some of that stuff, right? We kept it to the science, so we moved
1:17:52  on to sensory analysis, right? So, how do these compounds transform in roasting?
1:17:59  And then how do they extract in brewing? That's what we're going through tomorrow. Today we looked at how do we
1:18:06  evaluate the physical and then evaluate those compounds in terms of tasting, right? How does flavor work? To me that
1:18:12  is all kind of more science related um physiology, psychology, and then
1:18:19  compounds interacting with all that. That was kind of the goal of today. Tomorrow we get into the right the the
1:18:25  art of it, right? What happens when we manipulate the roast? How do those compounds react or develop or break down
1:18:31  or change? And then how do we extract coffee? How does water um you know
1:18:37  remove those compounds? But what can we change to kind of um you know make new
1:18:42  or different flavor experiences, right? That is the art of coffee tomorrow. And then there is the art of course of
1:18:49  service. um that is the last thing for many of us or just the art of drinking
1:18:54  um and enjoying coffee and kind of what that means to us, right? Everything we've discussed in every class is kind
1:19:00  of culminating to to that point, right? Um, the beauty of enjoying that kind of
1:19:05  singular one-of-a-kind experience.
